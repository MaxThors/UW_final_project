### Communication Protocols
For the duration of this project, Slack will be our primary communication vehicle. We've created a group chat there and so far it has proven sufficient to get feedback from one another and brainstorm.

We also have a standing weekly meeting at 7pm CST every Wednesday via Zoom, in addition to utilizing weekly class time to strategize next steps and perform our analysis.

### Presentation
We selected this topic to determine what ice cream flavor would be the best for our new ice cream company. For our new flavor, we want a specialty flavor. Our source data is several csv files from Kaggle that compiled flavors and customer reviews from four different ice cream companies. The flavor dataset includes the company, name of the flavor, and a description. The review dataset includes a product rating from 1-5, votes on whether or not other customers found each review helpful, and a written-out review. We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse out the written reviews in order to determine which words are most associated with higher ratings so we can better determine a flavor for our specialty ice cream. We're going to use this process to maximize efficiency in our product development process.
