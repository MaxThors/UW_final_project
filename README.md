### Communication Protocols
For the duration of this project, Slack will be our primary communication vehicle. We've created a group chat there and so far it has proven sufficient to get feedback from one another and brainstorm.

We also have a standing weekly meeting at 7pm CST every Wednesday via Zoom, in addition to utilizing weekly class time to strategize next steps and perform our analysis.
