0_bj,3,10.0,3.0,"Super good, dont get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* Id say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably wont buy again simply because it didnt live up to its promising package. Ill find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies. Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please."
0_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness."
0_bj,3,5.0,2.0,"My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesnt care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind."
0_bj,5,24.0,1.0,"Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don’t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I’d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I’ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!"
0_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt Ill be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream."
0_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"I am not a chocolate person at all, and this was my very first time trying Ben & Jerrys, (Shame on me Im 23 lol) so I was so excited to find a Caramel Ice Cream with BLONDE Brownie chunks instead of fudge. I really wanted to like this ice cream but I just couldnt. The Salted Caramel is a little too salty, In fact, I couldnt even eat the core, I just ate around it. I didnt really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didnt really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better). The only thing I loved about this Ice Cream were the Blonde Brownie Chunks, They were so delicious! I would love for this Ice Cream Recipe to be worked on, maybe Ill give it a try again in the future."
0_bj,2,8.0,6.0,"I LOVE caramel, so much so that I could eat it off a spoon, which was exactly what I was planning to do when I bought this ice cream. Unfortunately this caramel core is way too salty. I actually eat around it! Im not a fan of the sweet cream ice cream flavor either; vanilla wouldve worked better. The blondie pieces were delicious but overall Im disappointed. I really wanted to love this since I love Ben & Jerrys but this was not up to par with their other flavors!"
0_bj,3,3.0,2.0,"Ive seen this flavor multiple times at the grocery store the past few months and been tempted, finally pulled the trigger last week."
0_bj,4,2.0,1.0,"This was my 1st pint of Salted Caramel Core but not my first Ben and Jerry’s Core pint. My first impression was that my core was HUGE! It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint! Wow! And the caramel itself was delicious; salty sweet and gooey! The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely. My only issue was the blonde brownie bits. It’s not that they weren’t plentiful, I just really didn’t like the taste of them, which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER! The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren’t very good and I ate around them. So, all in all, it was a good pint with amazing caramel, good ice cream and funky brownies."
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,I know sweet cream ice cream probably wouldnt be a big seller but I wish B&J would make more flavors with a sweet cream base or just a plain sweet cream ice cream. When the flavor was 1st introduced I used to get this regularly but it got to a point I was throwing away most of the caramel because it was too salty. I will still occasionally purchase as there are no other flavors with sweet cream.
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Bought this recently because my local target has stopped carrying Blondie Ambition, which was my favorite. I love the sweet-cream ice cream; my container didnt seem to have very many blondie chunks (which was disappointing, see previous) and the salted caramel core was overly salty. It was okay. I might buy it again but would rather have Blondie Ambition."
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I really wanted to like this flavor but it was quite disappointing. Halfway into the pint, the core pretty much disappeared. There was way too much at the top and it wasnt dispersed evenly throughout the ice cream. The caramel was also way too salty for my tastes. Also wished there were more brownie pieces, only found a few in the entire pint."
0_bj,3,3.0,1.0,"Couldnt find any in my pint. But the rest is fabulous, dont change a thing!"
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I had a major craving for ice cream so of course I had to go to the store for some Ben and Jerrys! I was really excited about this flavor, but after a few bites I was gagging. It was too salty and there were barely any brownie chunks :/ Im really sad this ice cream is going to go waste, but Im not happy with my purchase at all."
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,Just bought this last night and like some of the other reviews there were only a few flecks of blondie. Mine was nothing like the photos. And so the combination of just ice cream and such salty caramel was disappointing and unbalanced. I dont know if the core extended to the bottom since I didnt eat enough to find out.
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"The salted caramel core tastes like someone went a little too salt happy. There was just too much core in ratio with the ice cream an in addition to the bad core to ice cream ratio, the core was just too salty to handle. Please fix the core because the ice cream itself with the blonde brownie bits are delicious."
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The blondie mix ins and sweet cream ice cream were nice, but I really wasnt a fan of the caramel core, because it was far too salty. Youve got multiple reviews saying that its too salty, please dont skim over those reviews. Please consider tweaking the recipe on this one so its less salty."
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I usually love salted caramel foods, and I adore Ben & Jerrys decadent ice creams. The ice cream was excellent, the brownie pieces were yummy, but the caramel tasted way too salty! The salt is supposed to compliment the caramel, not overpower it. Im pretty disappointed."
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I love anything caramel. I was super excited when I saw the whole core was salted caramel. However it was way too salty, I even tried mixing it with the sweet cream ice cream and it was still too salty. It could also use more of the brownie, which was certainly delicious."
0_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"There must have been some sort of mistake with the amount of salt mixed into the caramel. Nobody would but that much saint into a desert. The pint its still on our freezer. On a side note, Cherry Garcia is the best ice cream ever made."
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,Tried this flavor for the first time about two weeks ago it was delicious; But today I’m extremely disappointed. The core is so salty in this pint. I had other people try and they also agreed it was too salty. Don’t think I’m buying again.
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I am a lover of all things caramel, and while the ice cream and the blonde bites were delicious, I found myself eating around the core because it was just too salty. Tasted like caramel flavored salt. Very disappointed in this flavor."
0_bj,5,2.0,1.0,Salted caramel core is in my top three. My eating tactic is to scoop the ice cream from the outside and then smash the back of the spoon into the core so when I take a bite the first thing Im hit with is salty and then its sweet.
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"My daughter picked up this flavor for me to try because I love Carmel. I have to say, this is the worst flavor I have ever had. The blonde fudge was bland but the salted Carmel was the worst. It was so salty that I couldnt eat it."
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I love Ben & Jerry and was excited about the Salted Caramel Core, BUT the caramel is WAY to salty. I even tried to eat it with more ice cream But the salty flavor is too powerful. Disappointed, I know Ben & Jerry could do better !"
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Tried this for the very first time today. The caramel core was extremely salty. Way to salty to actually enjoy the caramel. Left a bad after taste. On a positive note, the core was gooey and easy to scoop out with a spoon."
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I really cant stand the flavors with chunks of cookie/brownie. It seems like Im eating something stale. Im in the minority but I stopped going to a convenience store near me because all they carried were those types.
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I had high hopes for this flavor, but the carmel core was way too salty. I was hoping for a sweeter kraft caramel taste. The blonde brownie bites were just okay...not much traditional brownie flavor. Won’t buy again."
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream but this one was horrible. The picture looks like there will be tons and brownies and there were only 5 tiny bites in the whole pint. The caramel core was overly salty too.
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,the caramel tastes like salty death. I think I have sodium poisoning from one bite. Gross as heck like why would you do this to people. Who let this pass the taste test??? Fr fr are y’alls tongues blind?
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I tried this ice cream when it first came out, didnt care for it. It seemed as though it was missing something and I really didnt like the salted caramel. I like the Karamel Sutra much better."
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The sweet cream and blondie chunks were delicious, but the core was almost too salty to eat. The taste of salt was completely overpowering the caramel flavor. Good overall, just needs less salt."
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,The core just tastes like salt with no caramel flavour. The ice-cream was floury & the blonde brownie pieces had no taste. Worst flavour I’ve ever had. Very disappointed. :(
0_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The ice-cream is disappointingly tasteless...why not use vanilla. The caramel us too salty and intense...why not swirled? The brownie bites were few and far between.
0_bj,2,1.0,0.0,I love Ben and Jerrys! The brownies and ice cream were very good! The caramel was just overwhelmingly salty. I couldnt even eat it. Maybe its just not for me. :(
0_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I had looked forward to trying this flavor but found the core saltier than the ocean. As someone who loves caramel this is the worst caramel I have ever tried. I
1_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"Ben and Jerrys took the peanut butter/chocolate flavor and knocked it out the park yet again. The peanut butter ice cream is great as always, but combined with the pretzel swirls, the flavor is heightened to an amazing degree. A nice little crunch to the pretzels as well for texture. The brownies arent quite as good as in other flavors but definitely plentiful and still tasty. Put em all together and you get a salty/sweet peanut butter and chocolate combination that just works. A great flavor."
1_bj,5,12.0,1.0,"The actual peanut butter ice cream is amazing, the brownie chunks taste like they were just cooked. The pretzel bits are the most amazing thing I have eaten, they are not too salty. They are not crunchy or too soft, evert time I get a bite with the pretzel in it I have to just stop and savor it. So far I have only found these at Target I have shared about eight pints in a couple weeks with my husband. Honestly its the best ice cream Ive ever had. Hard, soft, homemade, vegan or non, its the best."
1_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I will start by saying that Im not a peanut butter flavored ice cream fan(Im an urban bourbon addict)the only reason I tried this flavor was I couldnt find my flavor. Boy did this flavor SURPRISE me. Its a must try.
1_bj,5,2.0,0.0,My top two favorites of all time are Tonight Dough and Chubby Hubby (tied for first place) and a close second place is Netflix & Chill’d! The brownie pieces were HUGE and the salty sweet combo was just perfection.
1_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"This is EVERYTHING I want in ice cream! Peanut butter, sweet, salty & just enough chocolate. I hope it becomes a regular flavor."
1_bj,5,8.0,1.0,I am in love with this flavor. Im a big pb fan and it is very prominent.
1_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This is just simply amazing. I am not one for ice cream but this has changed my perspective, so many perfect flavors wrapped into one. Sweet yet salty, enough toppings in every bite. WOW! I look forward to this every night!"
1_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"The peanut butter flavor is good and the ice cream is creamy, but the balance of salty to sweet is way off. This tastes like peanut butter ice cream with pure salt swirled through it. The brownies are soft but flavorless, so they do nothing to help balance the flavors. I normally love salty sweet combinations, but this missed the mark."
1_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This flavor was AMAZING. I would not change anything about it! I never thought I would find anything better than Half Baked and Tonight Dough, but this flavor definitely made it up there with them."
1_bj,2,2.0,0.0,I was really disappointed in this one. Flavors were blah. The peanut butter icecream tasted more like vanilla and hardly any pretzel flavor. Chubby Hubby is a much better choice with similar concept
1_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"Salty and sweet, but could use more brownie chunks and pretzel swirls to achieve sheer perfection! The concept is there but my pint had paltry mix-ins."
1_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Honestly the best ice cream I have ever had. I was expecting good, but this is a game changer. B&J yall never let me down!"
1_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Ive be consistently buying this wherever I can! Please dont get rid of this!
1_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Please don’t take this away from me. It is the perfect ice cream.
1_bj,4,2.0,1.0,"Great pb flavor! Love the salty pretzel swirl! But the brownie pieces were too big and chewy, like a dog eating pb. I think I’d prefer it with a fudge swirl and larger pretzel pieces. Will try it again, maybe it will have smaller brownie chunks. Peanut Butter World is still my favorite."
1_bj,4,4.0,3.0,I got the chocolate fudge brownie and yes there is a great amount of brownie but I think the ice cream to brownie ratio should be more brownie less ice cream!
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,B&J did it again. The creamy smooth texture of the peanut ice cream contrasted with the swirl of salty pretzel goodness engaged with nice healthy chunks of brownies. Perfect combination of flavor and texture. Thank you B&J for making another wonderful creation. You guys rock!
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I finally got around to trying this flavor and I’m so glad that I did! I’ve been buying Ben & Jerry’s for the past 15+ years and this is one of the best flavors I’ve ever had. The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream itself is incredible. I’m thoroughly impressed.
1_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"Peanut flavor is exceptionally bold and delicious, however the saltiness is oddly mixed in, I’ve had bites of mild salty pretzel and really really salty bites. Could do a little better in that regard."
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this 3 days ago and just bought a second tub! Its absolutely perfect. I love the salty swirls and the brownies are soft and delicious. Please keep this flavour!
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Just tried this flavor and it’s officially my favorite! Perfect balance of sweet, salty and savory. The little bits of fudge are also SOOOOOOO GOOD! Can’t get enough"
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Amazing flavors and amazing taste. One of my top 3.
1_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Okay, so when I saw this flavor first advertised I was out of my mind excited. I love peanut butter. I love brownies. And I love pretzels. But when I finally tracked it down in stores, I was disappointed because it wasn’t what I was expecting it to be. (Also, it melted a lot on the way home that day.)"
2_bj,5,22.0,8.0,"During quarantine I was living off of Half Baked...but when I went to the store all that was left was Chip Happens. Having been heartbroken by another brands ""Milkshake and Fries"" I reluctantly bought Chip Happens. I am happy to report Ben & Jerrys NAILED this flavor. The lighter chocolate, chocolate chunks and the perfectly CRUNCHY salty potato chip swirl is EXACTLY what every sweet/salty craving is made of. I put on my quarantine mask and went back to the store and bought the 4 pints left. I need another freezer to stock this flavor. Hope it remains a regular flavor because it says ""limited botched edition"". Break quarantine and RUN to get Chip Happens!"
2_bj,5,10.0,6.0,My favorite flavor used to be Late Night Snack because of the amazing innovation of the salty potato chip balls they used in combination with the sweet ice cream. The combo is heavenly. Ive been waiting for years for Ben and Jerrys to bring back the potato chip ingredient and lo and behold yesterday at the store I found this flavor. Its even better than I remember late night snack being; the potato chip swirl provides a perfect salty and sweet combo in almost every bite. Please make this a permanent flavor; or at least release something else that uses this potato chip ingredient because Ill be SO sad if I have to wait years for it to appear again.
2_bj,5,9.0,1.0,"Please keep this as a permanent flavor as Ive introduced this to others and we all LOVE it! Just like as a kid putting chips in my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, this ice cream is the best thing since then! Love the chocolate ice cream with the chips!! Would love if you kept it around!!! Was bummed when I saw it was a limited botch Thank you!!!"
2_bj,4,5.0,0.0,"I tried this for the first time a few days ago and the pint is already gone. This is a perfect flavor for someone that likes the sweet and salty combo (e.g. chocolate covered pretzels). The chip pieces add a nice twist to the chocolate, and the texture/consistency is not weird. There are some bites that I feel the chip chunks are a little too big,but overall it is great!"
2_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I am a lover of all things sweet and salty, so when I saw this in my grocery freezer I just knew I had to try it. Ben & Jerrys did NOT disappoint with this flavor! Ive searched for and bought this flavor countless times since I first found it a few months back, and I enjoy it a little more each time. The sweet & salty balance in this one is perfect. The only downside I can say is that the consistency of the potato chips are often in botches and not evenly distributed throughout, but thats nothing some scoop controlling cant fix. Please keep this one permanently!"
2_bj,5,31.0,7.0,"This achieved what Late Night Snack could not--it is a FANTASTIC flavor. The chip swirls have the perfect salt content and potato taste. They stay crispy, which is a great complement to the thin crunch of the chocolate chips and that smooth, almost milk chocolate ice cream. THIS SHOULD BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR. ITS SO GOOD."
2_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I am not usually the type that likes a lot of mix-in’s in my ice cream, in fact, it would be accurate to call me a plain Jane. However, I just recently happened to go on to your website and saw that this was a new flavor so after a trip to the grocery store......my palette my most pleased. It was such a wonderful combination both with the velvety chocolate ice cream and then the salty crunch of the potato chips!! Well done———-you most definitely nailed it!!!!!"
2_bj,3,5.0,3.0,"Can I express how excited I was to see this on the shelves? I was beyond excited since I was a HUGE fan of Late Night Snack. Upon opening the lid, I noticed chocolate ice cream with giant chunks of chocolate chips and potato chips.On my first bite, I tasted molasses and then bits of chocolates and potato chips. I wasnt a fan of the strong taste of molasses.. Perhaps I was expecting something similar to the discontinued Late Night Snack. Chips Happen wasnt bad but it wasnt great."
2_bj,5,17.0,7.0,"Absolutely delicious. Sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy. This is a pint of oxymorons and I love it."
2_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I’m obsessed with this flavor since I tried it. I can not believe how amazing it is. And the potato chips have the perfect crisp (don’t understand how) but it’s delicious. Please please please keep this flavor :(
2_bj,5,2.0,0.0,When i saw this i thought it would be gross because chips and ice cream seems just gross together but when my sister convinced me to try it i felt fireworks. the chips are perfectly salty and the chocolate isnt to chocolaty! Its perfect for people who eat dip their french fries in chocolate ice cream and its a fun and unique flavor to try out! would highly recommend!! :D
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"When I first came upon this early June I tried the pint and within 5 minutes it was gone. The rich, velvety milk chocolate ice cream blends well with the contrasting textures of chocolate chunks and salty potato chips. I find a reason to drive 10 minutes 3 times a week just to stock up on this flavor exclusively. I am willing to lead the charge to make this flavor permanent. Its genius! I was disappointed that imy local store had sold out. I hope you consider this as a Fan Favorite!"
2_bj,2,6.0,3.0,"I was so excited to find this special pint - unfortunately, mine barely had the potato chip swirl I was looking forward to! Ben and Jerry’s are known for their ample mix ins, and this didn’t make the cut. Really bummed!"
2_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I’m a sucker for chocolate covered potato chips. This ice cream is my major weakness. The chocolate ice cream is the best (and I don’t care for chocolate ice cream). I hope this flavor stays.
2_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"You guys nailed this one! It is perfection, the sweetness of the ice cream with a hint of saltiness of chips. I’d buy it every time I went shopping if it was a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,1,8.0,6.0,I’ve had ice cream with chips before and enjoyed it so was excited for this one. But this flavor is truly terrible. My boyfriend and i each ate a scoop & decided to throw the rest away - a choice we’ve never made before.
2_bj,5,9.0,6.0,"I bought this in substitute of Americone Dream and I have got to say, I love this ice cream!! It tastes so good!"
2_bj,2,5.0,3.0,"Regular flavor made worse with potato chips. The combination of potato chips with chocolate ice cream is too strange for me. If you cant tell, I dont dip my fries in my milkshakes."
2_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"Perfect chocolate ice cream! I love the lighter, less intense chocolate ice cream that’s similar to one of my other faves (chocolate milk and cookies). It really tastes more like chocolate milk. The potato chip swirls are a perfect salty complement to the mild sweet. Im a huge fan of chocolate covered chips so this is right up my wheel house. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!"
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,After Trader Joe’s discontinued their chocolate covered potato’s chips I’ve been in search for something close. This nailed the same flavor and was so much better. Great mix of sweet and salty. It’s like in n out fries dipped in their chocolate milkshake. Turned my whole family onto this flavor and we bought out the two stores that carried it. Please Please continue the flavor!
2_bj,1,5.0,4.0,I love Ben&Jerrys but this flavor was a disaster. The chocolate doesnt mix with the saltiness of the chips and it just tastes so wrong.
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,this is my new favorite flavor. this chocolate base is better than any of their others and this potato chip swirl is incredible. i dont buy ben and jerrys that often because of the price point but i would for this pint! this is an incredible sweet and salty blend and i cant get enugh!
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I got this a number of days ago and it’s absolutely delicious. The chip swirl makes sure you get it throughout the ice cream. I really hope this stays in the collection!!
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Half Baked has been my favorite ice cream, but this beat it. I wish the whole potato chip, sweet salty thing was more popular because this is amazing."
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is my newest addiction. I have been buying as much as I Can before it’s gone. I’m begging for this to become a permanent flavor.
2_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Chip happens is my absolute new favorite ice cream! The chocolate and salty mix BEAUTIFULLY! Please keep it around!!
2_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"What a great combination of flavors, I truly hope this will be around for awhile."
3_bj,5,12.0,1.0,Am trying this flavor for the first time right now. Took my first bite and fell in love IMMEDIATELY!! May just be my new favorite flavor!! Have tried a different brand of mascarpone ice cream before and it basically just tasted like vanilla. This is the complete opposite!! Definitely not just plain old boring vanilla!! Can NOT believe how amazingly delicious this is!! Everyone needs to try this now!! Would probably drive 10 hours to get this if i had to like omg its just that good!!!!!!!!!! Please ben and jerrys-Im literally begging you to keep this flavor FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I was devastated when the “Holly Cannoli” flavor was discontinued years ago. Every time I passed the ice cream aisle in my supermarket, I’d search for the Cannoli flavor, hoping to see it again. Just when I was about to give up, THERE IT WAS!!!!! I scooped up every pint I could get my hands on. This flavor is the best!! The sweet marscapone cream and chocolatey shell pieces make for a sweet celebration for the tastebuds. Thank you so much for bringing this awesome flavor back! Please don’t ever discontinue it again. You’ve struck gold with this flavor — it is truly is a treat!"
3_bj,5,6.0,1.0,"Oh man. Where to begin. Two bites and I knew. The marscapone ice cream? Dude. The cannoli shells? DUDE. Theyre so crispy its almost like magic how crispy they stay. And coated in chocolate nonetheless! The marscapone swirl is something you almost forget about too but like not even in a bad way because you end up stumbling upon it without expecting to do so and it HITS YOU IN THE FACE WITH DECADENT FLAOUR. Also the chocolate chips are the minis, the cute ones. Perfectly sized!! B & J knocked it out of the park with this one. A+++"
3_bj,5,16.0,2.0,Please keep this around forever! For over 7 years I have hoped that this day would come where my favorite dessert ever would return! Such a delicious ice cream!
3_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"The icecream itself is luxuriously fatty, so it does take some time to eat this as compared to opposing flavors. The mascarpone swirls is what Id say takes the cake for me, though be aware that not all the chocolate-covered cannoli pieces will be as crisp as youd expect them to be."
3_bj,5,9.0,1.0,"This is so good, i have been eating one a day, please keep this around so i can keep eating it"
3_bj,5,5.0,1.0,"I have been craving, whining about, and reminiscing about this flavor for YEARS."
3_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"The flavor is great, but there were almost no pieces of the cannoli shell in the pint. My husband and I both thought it was strange, and maybe a bad batch because you can always count on the pints to be pretty full of all the good stuff listed in the description. But not this time. And I see from another review that maybe this isn’t a fluke after all. The cannoli shell is the best part of the dessert, so it shouldn’t be skimped."
3_bj,5,3.0,2.0,"A delicious take on the classic Italian dessert, B&Js Cannoli is a winner. The base is described as a marscapone flavor. Now marscapone isnt typically used for Cannolis but instead ricotta. Marscapone is a cream cheese used for cakes and other desserts. While not quite fitting the theme of a Cannoli in that regard, B&J made the right choice for the sake of flavor. The base is absolutely like a heightened cheesecake. Almost as if their regular cheesecake flavor was mixed with the equally delicious buttery brown sugar one. Its fantastic. The swirl is the same flavor, so they blend together seamlessly for a full on sweet cream cheese taste. And the pastry pieces are the perfect contrast to the base. Crunchy and covered in chocolate, they remind me of the similar chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces from Americone Dream, and there are plenty in each pint. Whether it fits the theme or not, Cannoli is a great flavor that I hope stays as a mainline one for a long time."
3_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"First of all traditional cannoli are made with ricotta, not mascarpone. This tastes more like tiramisu without the coffee. Its missing the liquor flavor of a cannoli and was too cheesy. It would be better if it had chocolate shavings, but the base is wrong. I ate it, but I would not it buy again."
3_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I happened to find this flavor when I went shopping today at Albertsons and I love all kinds of Italian cuisine. Cannolis are one of my favorite desserts. The flavor of this ice cream was delicious and tasted exactly like a cannoli! Perfect flavor!!
3_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was so excited to try this because I love a good cannoli. The taste was just wrong. I really didnt like anything about this flavor. The ice cream itself was marscapone which isnt whats in a cannoli. This was just a fail, cannot recommend."
3_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream is light and fluffy, just as expected from Ben & Jerry’s, but I think the mascarpone ice cream is just a variant of vanilla ice cream. The crunch from the chocolate shells is rad and the mascarpone swirls are delicious."
3_bj,4,1.0,0.0,Bought this a few days ago after searching for a while. So looking forward to it. I loved the flavors BUT it should have had way more cannoli shell pieces. There were barely any at all.
3_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Chunks were found throughout and I really enjoyed ice cream so reminiscent of my fave dessert.
3_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I absolutely love this flavor, and Im glad its back to stay and not a Limited Batch"
3_bj,5,2.0,1.0,Please keep the Cannoli ice cream!!!!! It is the best EVER!!!!!
4_bj,5,27.0,0.0,This is my favorite flavor in the entire world please make it a permanent flavor!! I made all my friends go out and try it and were all addicted. I have three pints a week. I wish I was joking. We single handedly bought all of the Gimme Smore stock in our grocery store. The day this flavor is retired is the day my happiness dies. :)
4_bj,5,20.0,0.0,"I have several favorite B&Js flavors, but I decided to go outside of my usual and get this flavor. With the first bite you can definitely taste a hint of marshmallow-y flavor in the base ice cream. Its different than just plain vanilla. I think they did a great job capturing that flavor. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham swirl is smart and I think its a unique way to add the classic flavor of a smore. And of course, you cant go wrong with fudge flakes! I am a total mix-in and swirl junkie, the more the better, and Ben & Jerrys never disappoints with that! Great job on this flavor! Overall a unique take on a novel summer treat!"
4_bj,5,42.0,6.0,"Ive had many pints of the Gimme Smore while its been out and tonight I accidentally grabbed the original Smores, with the chocolate ice cream. It was the most disappointing moment when I opened the pint to find chocolate ice cream instead of the typical golden ice cream I was used to with the Gimme Smore. Gimme Smore is the perfect representation of what a Smore is: mostly composed of perfectly toasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate, and a great trail of graham crackers. I will be so sad when this pint leaves the shelves. And I will never make the mistake of buying the OG Smores pint again. Too much chocolate to represent a Smore."
4_bj,5,17.0,3.0,"I recently had the pleasure of taking a tour of Ben & Jerrys in VT and this was the flavor sample of the day. Instantly, I was hooked. Ive been buying some from my local CT grocery store since. There was a sale one night and the store was out. I sat on the floor and cried. While the ice cream base may not taste exactly like marshmallows, is delicious. Everything about this flavor is amazing!"
4_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I am so sad that this is a limited batch. Gimme Smore is my all time favorite flavor and Ive tried almost all the Ben & Jerrys flavors. It is like heaven in your mouth. The graham cracker swirl and chocolate cookie swirl are my two favorite things about this ice cream. Since the flavor is slowly leaving, my friends and I have gone to multiple stores to stock up on what is left. As you can tell we LOVE Gimme Smore and if youre a smores lover like me then its worth the try!"
4_bj,5,13.0,1.0,"This is such a great new pint! I stocked up and my freezer is loaded with them. The ice cream, the swirls and chunks are so so yummy! If I could eat it every night, I would. This is a LIMITED BATCH! It did not replace S’mores. It’s still available in stores and online. Gimme S’more has come and will go again and regular S’mores will remain. The very first S’mores was retired but the one we’ve been enjoying for quite a while now is still there. So enjoy this for what it is and have your regular S’mores too."
4_bj,5,21.0,5.0,"This is so delicious! It tastes like an amped up cookies and cream but with a graham cracker taste. A Smore is like a cookie so Im not complaining. I also like it better than the Original. This is my new favorite flavor! I dont think the base tastes like regular vanilla at all. It may not be marshmallow-y, but its definitely a ""warm, dark"" and border-lining a faint molasses flavor versus a sweet, strong vanilla if that makes sense. This is my new addiction. I think newbie Ben and Jerrys consumers will take a liking to this one."
4_bj,5,11.0,3.0,"Honestly, I dont love ice cream. Its my least favorite dessert. But, about once a year I get a craving. I saw the Gimme Smore ice cream in the store and love smores so thought Id give it a shot. Total game changer. This is the best ice cream Ive ever had and Ive ended up buying it like 7 times. Im so sad its limited edition and hope it becomes permanent. Its perfectly simple and complex-I wouldnt change a thing. Im reviewing in hopes marketing people see its ratings and decide to keep it!!"
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I first tasted this heavenly creation on Dec 24th... And boy what a Christmas Miracle it was. The target I visited was out of my previous favorite Milk and Cookies, and I want in the mood for the ""chocolatey-ness"" of my other favorite the Tonight Dough."
4_bj,5,14.0,4.0,"I literally just bought this 20 minutes ago, put a little bit in a bowl, and decided I had to write the review. I agree with one reviewer where they said the marshmallow ice-cream doesnt really taste like marshmallow. However, I feel like thats a really difficult flavor to capture and the overall execution was very good. I totally tasted the graham cracker pieces and I LOVE the chocolate cookies BJ puts in their ice-cream. If I had to make a critique or suggestion, I would say maybe have more graham cracker swirls and/or flavor the ice-cream graham cracker and have marshmallow swirls with the cookie and graham crackers? I dont know though because Im pretty overkill with my ice-cream. If it doesnt sound like Im going to die it wouldnt be my first choice. All in all, I am so happy, Im struggling to not get more, and I would be very sad if this never came back."
4_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"The original smores ice cream was a dream come true, it was by far my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor and I even drove to Vermont to tour the facility and get a cone there. When I tried this replacement I had hope to be wowed but was left feeling nothing but disappointment. Smores do not have cookies in them so I am not sure where that idea came from, and normally I would like cookies in my ice cream but if I am looking for the flavor profile of a smore this ice cream just doesnt deliver."
4_bj,1,10.0,9.0,"My favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s is S’mores, which I have been a fan of since it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow but it is the HARDEST flavor to find! I saw Gimme S’more in my grocery and got so excited! But when I got home, I was disappointed. I thought my favorite part of S’mores was the graham cracker swirls which are also in this flavor, but it turns out, the Chocolate ice cream was more vital to the awesomeness of the flavor than I thought. The “toasted marshmallow” Ice cream just tastes like vanilla. While the add-ins are good, the ice cream part of this pint leaves something to be desired. I guess I’ll forever be on the hunt for my fave flavor “S’mores” because you can’t beat it! They shouldn’t have changed a good thing!"
4_bj,1,12.0,7.0,"S’mores is my favorite flavor EVER. So when I saw Gimme S’mores in my local grocery store I almost fell over I was so excited! However the excitement was short-lived because this is not s’mores. Not even the slightest bit. If I were blindfolded and tried this, I would never guess that it is s’mores flavor. The “marshmallow” ice cream is vanilla and there is no hint of graham cracker. The most overpowering part is the chocolate cookie swirl...which is not s’mores. Don’t get me wrong, the ice cream is good! If I were rating based on taste it would get 5 Stars. But I’m rating it based on how closely it captures the s’mores flavor. If I could give it a 0 I would because this is basically The Tonight Dough without the cookie dough and chocolate ice cream. So do yourself a favor and just get that because at least you have cookie dough."
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This was the best smore flavored edible substance I have ever consumed. Every time I saw ""Limited Batch"" on the label, I dreaded the day that would be my last time seeing it on the shelves. Mercy shone upon me each time, though, as upon return to my home, all the dread melted away as I rejoiced and beheld Heavens essence grace my mouth with the textured, creamy delight of Gimme Smore. Alas, the day finally encroached upon my innocent self that I would see in its stead, ""One Love"". Ive since settled for Milk&Cookies which I know can never fill the void once occupied by the dessert of unmatched divinity. I dream that one day Ill once again taste the treasure graciously gifted to this unworthy world by the great Ben and Jerry."
4_bj,5,18.0,6.0,"Way better than the previous s’mores recipe. Fantastic! I sat down with the pint and before I knew it, it was gone. Oops!"
4_bj,2,3.0,2.0,"As a long time fan of Ben & Jerrys, I have favorite flavors I always want. Being summer and seeing the store did not have any of my favorites, I thought I would try this ""new"" flavor. I have to say, it is not at all what I was hoping for. I am a marshmallow junkie and was hoping for toasted marshmallow flavor; instead, I felt like I was eating vanilla chocolate chip with some of those cake crunchies that you find in ice cream cakes. I will go back to my regular flavors or skip buying if Gimme Smore is my only other option."
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have been a hard-core regular cookie dough ice cream only fan for YEARS, but this flavor caught my eye at the beginning of summer and I havent been able to buy any other ice cream since! Its the amazing cookie swirl that almost convinced me that I could love the Tonight Dough flavor, despite my hatred for the nasty peanut butter dough. And the ever so creamy toasted marshmellow ice cream was a pleasant surprise! Even the graham cracker swirl blends in perfectly so you dont feel like you have random dry crumbs messing up the texture! Its the perfect combination that at times tastes like what an Oreo ice cream should taste like! I havent had my go-to cookie dough ice cream in over 4 months and will be incredibly sad when this masterpiece goes away!"
4_bj,1,8.0,3.0,"This flavor does not remind me of Smores at all. Why cookies? The chocolate flakes are more like big pieces... too big for this. I couldnt even finish the container. It wasnt worth it. first time Ive done that with Ben & Jerrys. Hopefully youll never quit making the original Smores, even if they are only in the shops."
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this flavor! I was excited to try this flavor because the other s’mores flavor has chocolate has the ice cream which I personally don’t like, so I was very happy to see this one with a marshmallow ice cream! I will say, marshmallow is a hard flavor to replicate, so the ice cream tasted more like vanilla to me. This flavor would have benefited from marshmellow bits mixed in. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham cracker swirl were amazing and crunchy! These swirls delivered on the s’mores flavor for me!"
4_bj,3,5.0,1.0,"I love s’mores, and don’t get me wrong this flavor is great, but not what I wanted. I was expecting more of a s’mores flavor, and I would explain this ice cream as more of a “marshmallow cookie crunch.” It’s still good! Just not s’mores. It would be better with gooey marshmallows :)"
4_bj,1,7.0,4.0,"I just bought this as well as my staple, cookie dough. Cookie dough was as usual amazing but this one was just a miss for me. It reminded me of the pint slices, not nearly enough toppings or pieces. It was mostly vanilla ice cream with some cookie pieces in it. Definitely not enough marshmallows to make it feel like a smores ice cream. Anyway, I love most of B&Js flavors but this one wasnt for me"
4_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"I like ice cream and I eat a fair amount of it but never have I had an ice cream that haunts my dreams like this one. This ice cream might actually be perfect. The toasted marshmallow base is excellent and not too sweet and the flakes of chocolate add the perfect crunch to the blend. Im not a big chocolate ice cream fan and I think that making the base marshmallow allows all of the flavors to be appreciated as one instead of being overpowered by chocolate. However, by far my favorite part of this ice cream is the graham cracker fudge swirl. Holy moley! It has a fantastic texture and the taste leads me on a whirlwind adventure. I dont know what I have to do to make this more than just a limited batch but I will do it. Every time I go to the grocery store I hold my breath that it will still be there waiting for me, cool and delicious."
4_bj,5,4.0,3.0,"This is my new favorite ice cream. While I agree that the base ice cream is not an exact replica of marshmallows, it does not taste like plain vanilla... more like the melted gooey inside of a marshmallow that’s not actually warm or gooey. The add ins are perfection to me between the swirls graham and chocolate cookie I’m in ice cream heaven. I have to carefully calculate my purchases so this is the only cheat on my diet each week! I hope it goes from “limited batch” to “here to stay”!"
4_bj,5,5.0,2.0,"I love a good vanilla based ice cream flavor, and this did not disappoint. I was skeptical to try to the flavor because of the reviews that were already posted but it was amazing. I loved the graham cracker bits. people complain its not like the regular smores flavor, uh hello duh the smores flavor already exists and is still in stores. This a tasty spin-off and does not disappoint"
4_bj,5,2.0,1.0,I have been buying this consistently for about 5 weeks almost like twice a week because I cannot get enough of this flavor. It’s honestly unhealthy for me at this point and for my bank account because I barely bought ice cream before taking a chance on this one. Delicious! The cookies and graham crackers are amazing in it. I literally went through the process of giving my info just so I could write this review in hopes that the flavor is continued and more people improve upon their lives by buying this flavor.
4_bj,2,5.0,1.0,"Hmm tasty but not s’mores. Just tasted like cookies n cream with some extra chocolate chunks. No graham cracker flavor. Wish the base actually tasted like toasted marshmallow, but unfortunately the flavor isn’t coming through. Oh well!!"
4_bj,1,7.0,3.0,I love Ben and Jerry’s but they missed the mark on this one. This is nothing even faintly reminiscent of S’mores ice cream. Now this one replaced the original S’mores and I can’t find it. Very disappointed.
4_bj,1,5.0,4.0,"The previous Smores was so much better. The chocolate ice cream tasted much better than the marshmallow one. When I went to the store and didnt see the other one anymore (which btw was my favorite flavor ever!) and saw this one I decided to give it a try, but overall I was very disappointed. The ice cream itself is not good and the chocolate cookies do not taste like smores to me. Please bring the old one back!!!"
4_bj,2,5.0,3.0,Its vanilla ice cream not toasted marshmallow. That alone was extremely disappointing. A little graham cracker swirl was ok. Just didnt go with the ice cream. I did like the chocolate cookie swirl. It basically was a cookies and cream ice cream taste. Only a little bit of fudge flakes but thats fine with me. Extremely disappointed. I love marshmallow.
4_bj,3,5.0,2.0,"Its ice cream, of course it still tastes good... but sadly this tasted nothing like smores. Marshmallow ice cream taste nothing like marshmallow, and the chocolate cookie took over the graham cracker flavor."
4_bj,2,6.0,3.0,"The ice cream base is suppose to be a toasted marshmallow flavor but to me it is just vanilla ice cream. This ice cream to me tastes like cookies and cream to be honest, save your money and just make a smore."
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Few Ice Creams in life have a perfect blend of flavor, texture, and eatability (which I know is not a word, but I have made it up for this review!). You can eat Gimme Smore! for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and still be able to find a way to have more more bite as dessert. You can eat this straight, or as a dope milkshake. I really hope this flavor sticks and goes into permanent rotation. Good job Ben and Jerry - keep up the great work!"
4_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"Ben and Jerry’s, PLEASE keep this one around. I loved the old S’mores too but this one is so much better. I know most flavors end up in the graveyard but if this one ends up in the graveyard it will be a tradgedy on par with human trafficking."
4_bj,5,2.0,0.0,My girlfriend bought one for us to try. Went back and bought each our own.
4_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"I like this version better than the original, however it still doesnt taste like smores. There needs to be a smoky element, whether that be smoked salt or bits of charred marshmallow. Also there needs to be a LOT more graham. I couldnt taste it at all. This ice cream has the potential to be amazing & legendary. Its tough to re-create the taste of a real smore though. Hope you keep trying."
4_bj,5,2.0,1.0,Delicious! Great ice cream and the swirls are perfect! I eat my Ben and Jerry’s with one of my son’s toddler spoons to help make the pint last longer (as I always eat the whole thing) but this one I couldn’t help but take huge bites anyway. I really like this flavor! I could have maybe gone for a little marshmallow swirl in addition just for a texture contrast but that’s not a big deal.
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have been FEENING for this ice cream. It is hands down the best ice cream I’ve had in my entire life. Do you know how tormenting it is, to find your favorite ice cream then it goes out of stock? Then you try a million different flavors and none of them do what the Gimme s’mores does. ITS THE BEST. PLEASE. I beg you. Bring this back as a permanent flavor. The people need it."
4_bj,4,3.0,2.0,"Its pretty much another cookie bit flavor similar to ""The Tonight Dough"" and ""Milk and Cookies."" Its pretty tasty though. So.... if youre expecting an authentic smore flavor, youll be disappointed. But if you like cookies-n-cream types compared to the two popular flavors I compared it with, youll enjoy it."
4_bj,1,5.0,3.0,Im so sad theyve discontinued the previous smores recipe for this.
4_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"So, its not like this ice cream is bad, but the name and description are very misleading. I would call it more of a cookies and cream because there is no marshmallows. And its not a very good cookies and cream. Definitely one of my least favorite flavors:("
4_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"Probably my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor. The marshmallow ice cream is super tasty, I love the chocolate cookies. The original smores flavor is too chocolate-y for me, so I much prefer this one. My only complaint: I wish there were more graham crackers."
4_bj,1,3.0,2.0,I may have gotten a bad one but there were no swirls of anything. Just specs of stuff. Plus it was very hard.
4_bj,1,3.0,2.0,I can’t find regular S’mores anywhere anymore. This is a sad excuse for a replacement if that’s what’s happening. It’s your best flavor.
4_bj,2,1.0,0.0,There are no graham crackers or marshmallow swirls. Doesnt even taste like smores. Chocolate chunks are the best part.
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,The chocolate cookie swirls in this blew my mind. Combined with the graham cracker and marshmallow WOW so good.
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Chocolate Fudge Brownie used to be my fave until I tried this. I’m SO glad I did. This stuff is heavenly!
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My daughter and I loved this, i hope it returns as i think weve gotten the last ones at our local grocer"
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Literally the best ice cream ever made. My new favorite. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!!!
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Currently stuffing myself with heaven and I gotta say this is the best flavor I’ve ever had
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This one is 10 times better than the other smore one! Please keep making this one!
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is so good and I really wish Ben & Jerrys would make it year round!
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I have been on a journey to find the best Ben and Jerrys ice cream. This may be it
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So good- I’ve bought it several times. The cookie crumble is the best part.
4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My new favorite ice cream! So much better than the original s’mores flavor!

4_bj,5,1.0,0.0,THE BEST ICE CREAM ! Please keep it around!!!
5_bj,5,10.0,1.0,"A flavor Im glad to see back after liking it before it was discontinued, PB Half Baked is even better than I remembered. Theres not much to say if youve already had the standard half baked. It works very similarly except that the vanilla portion of the flavor is now replaced with peanut butter ice cream, and the chocolate chip cookie dough is instead peanut butter cookie dough. For such slight changes though, they do make a big difference. One thing I disliked in the original half baked was how weak the vanilla base was and how it was completely dominated by the chocolate. Thats not the case here as the peanut butter taste to the ice cream is strong enough to balance out the chocolate, giving the classic combination we know and love. The balance is also matched perfectly with the mix ins. There are HUGE brownie squares in this flavor, tasting great as always, and combined with the numerous peanut butter cookie dough pieces, youre getting the chocolate/peanut butter taste in every bite. If youre a fan of that flavor combination, you cant go wrong with Peanut Butter Half Baked."
5_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Normally the tonight dough is my go to. I have been waiting for this flavor to get to my area and went it finally did I made sure run right to the store. I was in LOVE after the first bite . This is by far the best peanut butter ice cream flavor ever made. I beg and plead for this flavor to never go away because I am forever hooked. Thank you thank you thank you for my new favorite ever. This is a MUST TRY because you won’t look back
5_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I bought this at a Ben & Jerry’s store a couple days ago in Sandbridge, VA and it was oh so good! I am a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter and this did not disappoint. My son took one lick and was jealous he did not pick it so we went back again last night and bought some for him! I love the peanut butter ice cream and fudge brownie and didn’t realize the cookie dough is peanut butter too, yum! Now that I am home from vacation I just need to find it near where I live!"
5_bj,5,1.0,0.0,First of all I would like to say THANK YOU to whoever decided to put peanut butter in half baked! Half Baked is my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor but Im not a huge fan of vanilla ice cream... I just think the Peanut Butter ice cream really pairs well with the rest of the components in this mix. Dare I say... I might like this BETTER than the original Half Baked? Its too soon to tell. I love you Ben & Jerry!
5_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"The ice cream has chunky brownie, amazing cookie dough... Just amazing stuff!"
5_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"It’s everything you could wish for that would make being stuck at home seem a real treat. Chunks abound! The peanut butter and chocolate combination is hearty, decadent and worth it!"
5_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Yes. Just yes. Nothing else needs to be said. This ice cream is it. Buy it. Try it. Love it.
6_bj,5,19.0,1.0,"All time favorite flavor! The berry flavored swirls of ice cream are perfectly delicately, but distinctly, flavored. The natural pastel purple that comes from the blackberries is definitely an adorable plus! The mascarpone ice cream swirls have that heavenly cheesecake-y taste, which combines with the soft crumbly shortbread to create a tiramisu-esque experience... but instead of the rich notes coming from cinnamon it comes from the crunchy fudge-covered almonds. May I suggest renaming this flavor to ""Chuck Berry Mascarpone"" after Chuck Berry: one of the pioneers of rocknroll."
6_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This is without a doubt the best ice cream I have ever tried from Ben and Jerrys, and probably from anywhere at all! There is a B&Js scoop shop down the street from my apartment, one a couple miles away, and countless grocery stores in between. However, I constantly find myself driving out of the way to go to the only store in the area that I know stocks this flavor regularly. It is the perfect combination of flavors, and I have a really hard time keeping myself from going through the whole pint in one quick sitting. I will be absolutely devastated when this exclusive flavor is no longer available. Please keep it as a regular!!"
6_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"A lot of recent flavors from Ben and Jerrys have left me disappointed but I saw this at Whole Foods and had to give it a go, because Im like a Ben and Jerrys expert at this point. I thought it was going to be gross but I was pleasantly surprised by how all the flavors complimented each other. I left a few other people in the house have a small spoonful and they liked it as well. And to the person who said Strawberry Cheesecake is gone, you are wrong. That flavor is everywhere and never going away. Perhaps your store just stopped carrying it. It would be nice if they brought back the Blueberry Cheesecake flavor that was an exclusive at Walmart years ago. Anyway, Blackberry ice cream gets thumbs up from me!"
6_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is my new favorite ice cream!!! It is absolutely delicious! I saw this at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try since I was craving ice cream with berries and I was so pleased when I got home and tried it. This flavor has just the right amount of sweetness and the flavor combo is to die for. The chocolate covered almonds and cookie bits not only add to the flavors but provide a great texture. I usually dont write reviews but this is so good and Im afraid it will only be a limited time product. I hope they keep this one. Ill buy it forever. Recommending to all my family and friends.

6_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"first of all--the pieces of cookie throughout the ice cream are EVERYTHING! I love the balance of flavors. Its so good. Im actively searching for it which is the primary reason I ended up on this website, but figured Id add a review and give it 5 stars to keep it on shelves."
6_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This is a great balance of flavors -- each one compliments the other and none of them are too over powering. Creamy, sweet, and a little fruity. I especially like thats it not jam packed with fixings and you get to taste the actual ice cream."
6_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Great flavor combination. I wanted to try it because it was a new flavor and ended up loving it! Definitely in my top 5. My only criticism is that is it difficult to obtain.
7_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"This is my Favorite Ben & Jerrys Flavor ever, I wish it was easier to find. so many pB cups !! #LOVE that !! I really hope they make it permanent, because their is not very many other options for banana lovers. (I Hate the toppings in Chunky Monkey (◕︿◕✿)) would love if they added fudge brownies"

7_bj,5,6.0,0.0,It’s like chunky monkey but with peanut butter cups instead of nuts!
7_bj,5,3.0,0.0,This is the best Ben & Jerrys Ive ever had! I can no longer eat nuts so the peanut butter cups are the best alternative to Chubby Hubby. I hope this flavor is available forever!
7_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Bought this on a whim and its the best B&J flavor of them all.
7_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My local store sold out completely of this flavor, no word when it’s coming back. :( I love it. The banana so good. It’s the better version of chunky monkey! The cups are perfect!"
8_bj,5,34.0,3.0,"Happened upon this at the grocery store, and knew I needed to get it. Ive been enjoying Jen & Jerrys for decades, and my favorites before this were Cherry Garcia, Apple Pie a la Mode (from years ago - I heard this one couldnt be added to the reg. menu because the price of apples fluctuates too much), Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, then Half-Baked, and more recently Cinnamon Buns. This one combines SO MANY of my favorites: cinnamon, dough, chocolate, brownies ... and now SPICE. YAS. I LOVE spiced and spicy chocolate, and what has been created here with this special edition is just EVERYTHING. PLEASE keep *churning* this one out!!! ;D It is simply the BEST."
8_bj,5,20.0,1.0,I have been hooked on half baked for years now but this flavor changed everything! There’s just so much depth of flavor. I thought the spicy brownie would be too much but it’s very mild. I’d still prefer normal brownie but not by much. I love that the cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are two different ice creams swirled together. At first glance I thought it was going to be just chocolate ice cream with cinnamon flavor but I was wrong. Every bite is a unique balance of flavor that sends my tastebuds to heaven. I just wish it wasn’t a limited batch. I can’t go back to just half baked after this.
8_bj,4,8.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this flavor--interesting, but not so far out there that I couldnt wrap my taste buds around it (I was a bit skeptical about the spice factor, but it was nice and mild). However, while the pint succeeded in taste, it fell short on execution (bad pun unintended, considering the name). The chocolate base was noticeably less dense than the cinnamon, and was riddled with tiny air bubbles. It still tasted great, but the creaminess was inconsistent, and likewise, there were plenty of dough gobs but only 3 big brownie chunks. Seems like Justice Remixd just needed a a bit more balanced mixing. For reference, my pints info: UPC 076840036745, Date FEB0621BJ52, 5095 09:20 67834702)"
8_bj,5,28.0,0.0,"I bought this flavor today. Upon trying it, I immediately wanted to go back to the store & buy every pint that they had. SOOO GOOOD!!! Please keep this as a permanent flavor, instead of a limited batch. This is one of the best flavors youve designed in a long time (except for the sour sorbet this summer)."
8_bj,5,18.0,2.0,"Oh man. I dont even seek out ice cream that often, but this flavor caught my eye and now I am an absolute fiend for it. Im getting emotional thinking about this ice cream. I tell everyone I know to please try this ice cream. I sent out text messages to my family telling them to go buy this ice cream. I have never tasted anything like it in my life! Please keep it forever! Im obsessed! (And of course I am also happy to hear about the nonprofit partnership.)"
8_bj,5,27.0,1.0,"This is delicious. I didnt know what to expect when I read the description of the flavor, but OMG its so good. It takes like the Abuelita brand hot chocolate with a little hint of spice from the brownies. I love it!"
8_bj,5,16.0,0.0,I was a little nervous about the spicy brownies but oh my gosh! I love this flavor!! Please be a regular flavor not a limited batch!!! It’s so good!!!
8_bj,5,17.0,1.0,"This hit every sweet spot for me. Im serious. Absolutley loved this flavor, and Im actually a little sad I tried it, because if its a limited edition flavor that means itll go away and never return. This needs a spot in the regular rotation. Dont make me go back to the store and hoard all of them."
8_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I love cinnamon more than any other flavour in general (in cakes, bubble gum, tequilla, porridge ... - you see, ice cream is certainly no exception), so i was really excited to try the ben & jerrys cinnamon bun, when I saw that flavour for the first time some years ago. Unfortunately, when it comes to ice cream, I strongly prefer chocolate over vanilla or caramel as a base, so I the cinnamon bun flavour didnt blow my mind completelly. Just 1 hour ago I saw THIS new flavour at a gas station and coudnt resist. Its even better than I expected, because the spiciness harmonize so well with the cinnamon & chocolate (that I always love). So I highly recommend this ice cream flavour to anyone, who really loves cinnamon in general and chocolate ice cream."
8_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"The Ben & Jerrys line of ice cream is some of the best I have ever tasted. When I spied this, the newest in the freezer at my local grocery I was intrigued. So I ponied up my cash and brought it home. As usual, I popped the top and took a taste. OMG! I was floored. This has to be added to the line-up as a permanent option.It is everything I did not expect it to be. The flavors burst in your mouth! The combination of cinnamon and chocolate, although seemingly odd, are perfect together. And the ""topping on the cake"" is the spicy fudge brownie. Love this new flavor."
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"I cant stop buying this flavor. The balance of cinnamon ice cream, chocolate ice cream, tiny chunks of cinnamon bun dough, and bits of spicy brownie?! OH MY GOD. Its perfect. I saw a picture of this flavor online and then noticed it in my local grocery store, so I bought it. That was a month ago and now I cant stop. Please please please, Mr. Ben and Mr. Jerry I am begging you from my soul to keep this in the permanent rotation. JUSTICE TASTES DELICIOUS."
8_bj,5,13.0,1.0,So glad to see B&J step it up on the activism front as well as on the taste buds front! This is a delicious ice cream
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"This flavor combination is out of this world with perfect balance of flavors, textures and ... that cinnamon spice is everything. i wanted to try this initially because I support the cause and I was curious about how the flavor combo would be - and now I’m here begging you to add this to the regular rotation of flavors even though I never write reviews. I just went and bought out my local stores stock. Please add this to the regular line up!"
8_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"I saw this in the store and had to buy it as soon as I saw the words ""spicy brownie."" They werent lying, the brownies have a really interesting kick! I can understand why it was too strong for some, but for me it made up for the lack of cinnamon promised in the ice cream and cinnamon bun dough (which basically was like their cookie dough in texture minus the chips). This is a flavor for people who like the classics but are bold enough to try out some more exotic ones. Overall, one of the most intriguing flavors Ive had from Ben and Jerrys."
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"Im not sure I will ever love again! This is a fantasticly unusual combination that just hits every mark for me. I can usually ration out my pints over a couple weeks, but this flavor only lasts me two sittings! Anytime you need a break from the sugary cinnamon, the deep rich chocolate is there to smooth things over with a little spice and vice versa. I would definitely become a regular fanatic if this became a daily flavor (r.i.p. my diet)"
8_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Its so good! The cinnamon seems to pervade the entire pint and the spicy brownie bits are so tasty and interesting! I dont think that Ben and Jerrys has another flavor with a spicy element and I dont think that they need another one if they were to just keep this one around, which is exactly what they should do! I am gonna be so sad when they take this one away. I get that its kind of a weird flavor but it seems like the people who like it, REALLY love it."
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"This flavor is exactly what I didn’t know I needed, the cinnamon ice cream and hint of heat from the brownies really make it something special. I hope Justice ReMix’d becomes a regular flavor, it’s one of the best in the Ben and Jerry’s lineup and I’d be so sad to see it go."
8_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"Someone brought this in at work and I immediately fell in love with it. It has chocolate, chunky dough, and cinnamon!! So Good!"
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"This flavor combined my two favorite desserts - chocolate and cinnamon rolls. To me, it tastes like the Mexican hot chocolate, Abuelita - which I LOVE! I didn’t read that the brownies were spicy, so I was confused at first, but it was a great addition!"
8_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"I’m an ultimate half baked person, and this is amazing and just what I wanted. Please keep it is so good!!!"
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Whoever expresses this as a disappointment is wild. All these flavors paired wonderfully and the spice to the brownie is like a cinnamon spice and so delightful. Ill be sad once this is gone! Love it!!
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This is my favorite flavor ever. Its the only flavor I buy now when I get ice cream and I always buy 3 or 4 pints of it at a time out of fear it wont be there when I go to the store next. I love the cinnamon and spicy brownie combination. There isnt a substitute to this and I will actually cry when its no longer available.
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"I am in love with this ice cream as of many others I know, I always seem to become OBSESSED with a product when it is a “Limited edition” item. For the first time ever I am actually contacting a company in hopes to continue my obsession with this fantastic ice cream. PLEASE keep this flavor available!! :)"
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"This is how every flavor pint should be! Gorgeous chunks evenly distributed throughout, creamy, chocolatey with a cinnamon zing. Phenomenal."
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This is actually some of the best ice cream I have Ever had. All the spicy elements blend perfectly with the chocolate to create something I can only describe as the apotheosis of Mexican hot chocolate. Please dont take this deliciousness away from me!!! Make this a regular flavor!
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"Bought this yesterday at my local supermarket and ate half the pint already. Love it, love it, love it."
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Please keep this flavor definitely one of my favorites I can’t get enough of it!!!!!
8_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Please please PLEASE keep this flavor!! It is my all time favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor!
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I love the cinnamon bun and cant find it saw this and tried it! Best flavor ever! Please please please.keep!
8_bj,5,4.0,0.0,Loved the cinnabon pieces and the spicy brownie pieces!
8_bj,5,6.0,1.0,...and you will not change my mind. Its cruel and unusual that this is a limited edition batch.
8_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This is the kind of pint that I could eat in one sitting, but have to hold back to save more for the next day. The combination of flavors are exquisite in my opinion!! Nothing to complain about for me. If you’re scared of the spicy chocolate, know it is not very spicy and quite delicious. THIS ICE CREAM NEEDS TO BE PERMANENT because I’ve realized I can’t live without it now. Please consider keeping it!!!!"
8_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I was skeptical initially on the spicy fudge brownies, but holy Hannah! It’s 1000% amazing! It is darn near impossible to stop at one serving. I hope this stays around for a while, or I’ll have to get another freezer to stock up!"
8_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Id never had a favorite ice cream flavor before I tried Justice ReMixd and now Ive gone through five pints and counting and I would sacrifice my firstborn to keep it in the roster forever
8_bj,5,2.0,0.0,At first I didnt feel the spice from the brownie but when its eaten alone its definitely there. This flavor is sooo good. I wish it would be a permanent flavor.
8_bj,4,2.0,0.0,I was really excited to try this one when I heard about it I love the spicy sweet aspect and really wish they would make this one of the regular flavors
8_bj,3,2.0,0.0,The ice creams are blah but the spiced up brownies saved the pint...until I ate it. All.
8_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"My curiousity stopped on the label at gobs of cinnamon bun dough, so I didnt even notice the ""spicy fudge brownie"" part. Turned out I dont actually like the little cinnamon dough buttons (easy to spit out), but the spicy brownies really made this worth the purchase. I hope they revisit it again, Loving the cinnamon/spicy chocolate combo."
8_bj,3,4.0,2.0,The icecream itself and the cinnamon buns were good but the brownie was too strongly spiced.
8_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I havent found a new ice cream flavor like this in awhile. I would love to have it permanently, because it is my fave flavor currently! Very odd, but satisfying. The spiciness of the brownies works perfect with the sweetness of the mix of the cinnammon bun dough and ice cream. Id love to see more creativity like this in my ice cream!"
8_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Ever since this ice cream has come out I always have a pint of it in the fridge. Seriously right now I have 3. Not only is this my favorite ice cream of all time but it also supports a great cause so maybe we can be lucky enough to keep this pint because as long as you guys make it I will keep buying it.
8_bj,5,2.0,1.0,NEEDS TO BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR! I can’t believe there’s a flavor that combines my favorites— cinnamon bun with Half Baked. Every bite was so interesting and delightful. A whole pint goes down eeeeasy. I hope I can find this again. DEFINITELY a new favorite.
8_bj,5,2.0,1.0,Was first time trying and Im addicted the spicy fudge brownies paired with the sweet chocolate ice cream and cinnamon bun dough is to die for thanks @Ben&Jerrys for the best Ive cream always - Ricco
8_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Oh my gosh, I loooooooove the mixture of chocolate and spicy brownies! It reminds of Mexican hot cocoa. I vote to keep this flavor forever!"

8_bj,5,1.0,0.0,New favorite ice cream. Ate all of it in one night. Heck yeah
9_bj,5,20.0,0.0,"I love this flavor, and am already sad that it is a limited item. Yummy chocolate ice cream with crispy toffee & fudge cows and sugar cookie core. Its all amazing, and a terrific combination! Please please please, how do we make it a regular flavor?"
9_bj,5,15.0,0.0,Bought this the other day and omg I am in love! This needs to be available always please don’t take it away it’s too good to not be around for long!!! The sugar cookie core is to die for!!
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I’m just gnna say. This one makes me wanna sit on the couch and just smile n dance like a chunky little kid gettin’ their ice cream shimmy on!!! The chocolate ice cream, for some reason, tastes so dang good in this batch! The toffee bits are such an awesome touch to it. The fudge cows, another awesome texture element with a hit of a nice bittersweet dark chocolate to contrast the sweet/salty toffee crunch and silky smooth milk chocolate ice cream. But the dang killer here is....... that SUGAR COOKIE CORE. WHOA B&J... ur just showing off now. That stuff.... is like.. out of this world (; U should really put a litttlleee more in the pint hehe! :D But anywho, it’s Uber yummy!! Wouldn’t be surprised if it became a next hit and stuck around!"
9_bj,5,8.0,0.0,"This is my favorite Netflix B&J flavor and I will be purchasing again. I was worried this would be too sweet but has the perfect balance of chocolate, toffee, fudge, and sugar cookie core. The sugar cookie core is not overbearing like some other core flavors. I also love the that the texture is both smooth and crunchy. I hope this become permanent"
9_bj,5,6.0,0.0,The combination of flavors in this ice cream is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was lucky enough to find one pint and have been searching for more. I really hope this becomes a regular flavor because I’m obsessed. I’ve been checking all the stores nearby and everywhere is sold out. Please please please keep this one around!
9_bj,5,17.0,3.0,The combination of flavors makes an incredible medley for your taste buds! It was exciting to try a new flavor. The sugar cookie dough is absolutely heavenly. You have to try this new flavor combination!
9_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"Hole-y Cow!!! (Hole-y as in holes. You know, because craters...? Oh well.) Couldnt wait for Boots to show up in stores, so when it did, I pounced. I would be over the moon if this was made a regular flavor. For heavens sake, do it! This is one of the best B&J flavors Ive ever had. Been eating B&J for decades."
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I tried this last week for the first time on a whim (because there was no other B&Js left at the grocery store). I was nervous because myself and my partner are not usually chocolate ice cream lovers but this one has changed our minds!! The cookie core and other bits balance out the chocolate ice cream PERFECTLY. Ive been trying to track it down again since but it seems people have caught on to it and its been sold out. You have to try it!
9_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"My son and I can’t stop talking about how good this flavor is, and how we would sign a petition to get it made a permanent Ben and Jerry’s variety! Please continue to make it...the combination of fudge and sugar cookies and toffee! oMG!"
9_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"After searching all the stores in my area, I was finally able to get my hands on what I now believe to be my new favorite. Please dont let this be a limited batch! Its too good to disappear!!!!"
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I bought this flavor a week ago, hearing about it from the office ladies podcast. It sounded good and I love supporting them and also Space Force, so I had to buy it. I am not kidding when I say this is literally the best flavor I’ve ever had. And it’s not even close to my old favorite go-to of cookie dough and cookies and cream, so that says ALOT. This needs to be a permanent flavor. 500 stars."
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I got a serious case of the munchies and this was the best icecream a person could ask for...A ice cream for the Gods! and them mini chocolate cows got me feeling like a archaeologist digging thru looking for there goodness. Hats off!!
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Move over Phish Food and Cherry Garcia and Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz and Americone Dream- all legit faves of mine! And make room New York Super Fudge Chunk because there is a new Wowzer in space!! PLEASE make this one stay in orbit!!!
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Searched high and low for this flavor. Finally found it and bought 6 pints! Everyone in our family (5 of us) is obsessed with it. Hands down a winner! Especially love the toffee clusters in this ice cream!
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"The toffee bits sold me on this initially, but every part of this flavor was a delicious surprise! Everything from the milk chocolate ice cream to the cookie core... so good!!"
9_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite icecream. I really hope you guys keep it on forever. Usually it takes me months to finish a pint (I know, its weird) but this one I finished in a day."

9_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I went back and bought the rest of them at my local store. Please make these a regular flavor!
9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Im sitting on the couch devouring this entire pint. Make this flavor permanent, i need it in my life. Love chocolate based ice creams with crunchy additions like almonds, chocolate, toffee, etc. Most are ruined with marshmallow so this was an exciting flavor to find! My other fave is New York Super Fudge Chunk. We need more chocolate flavors like these!"
9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I went to five stores in my area looking for ""Boots on the Moon"". I love all things MOON, and I thought I would like it, and I was wrong - I LOVE it! I had some for breakfast today...and dinner tonight. I am glad I live alone, so I dont have to share it! Am I addicted to it? Will an intervention be called for? Tune in, and make it regular!!!!"
9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My usual pint, Milk and Cookies has taken a back seat. The sugar cookie core + the toffee is a combination to DIE FOR. Plus, we all know the delight that is B&J chocolate ice cream."
9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"One of my new favorite flavors, I’m so sad that it’s not a regular flavor. The sugar cookie core is my favorite part, and the toffee clusters add a great sweet crunch. Would definitely keep purchasing this if they made it a regular flavor."

9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is seriously my fave!!! Please make it permanent!!!
9_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My new favorite flavor from you please make more!!!!!
10_bj,5,12.0,2.0,"I loved this ice cream so much I typed in Ben and Jerrys Americone Dream is amazing into Google. I wanted to add a review since there was only one so far... To my surprise the cone was still crispy and the amount of fudge covering the cone was not overwhelming whatsoever. But the caramel swirl is fantastic quality, bringing back memories of the first time I had caramel with a side of Apple. I chose this because I was looking for a non traditional flavor but not too rich, now dont get me wrong, eating half a pint is definitely a hefty load on the gut but it doesnt feel too busy and you still get to enjoy the ice cream."
10_bj,5,6.0,0.0,Ive gone back to this flavor after favoring The Tonight Dough and the Caramel Core ones. I forgot what I was missing. I bought 2 the last time they were BOGO at Publix and go 2 more before the sale ended. I love caramel(I hate fudge) and the crispy chocolate covered waffle cones are tasty. Also I dont see many other options with waffle cone pieces. There have also been a lot of waffle cone in the pints.
10_bj,5,10.0,0.0,"Tastes good, satisfies my sweet tooth, and definitely represents the Americone Dream!!!! Also, you dont have to feel guilty about eating a pint because youre eating ice cream for charity (its like a tax deduction.... calories get deducted if theyre for charity)!!!!"
10_bj,5,10.0,0.0,"I typically try every new flavor that comes out when I see them. When they have no new flavors to try, my default is American dream. I love it!"
10_bj,5,15.0,3.0,"I eat a pint when I am sad, I eat a pint when I am happy, I eat a pint when I want to be happy... I keep eating this ice cream... SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD. This ice cream is truly dreamy"
10_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"I am not a big fan of vanilla ice cream. In fact, if it isnt coffee or chocolate I am usually not a fan at all; however, Americone Dream is a mix of fabulous flavors! No toppings or modifications are needed to make this a tasty treat for my son and I. The touch of waffle cone is a nice addition (though crunchier cone would be even better). Thanks for making a great ice cream!"
10_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Fell in love at the first taste and havent looked back. No other ice cream can compare. June 19 was the first I saw and heard of the slices and now I wont sit and eat the entire pint. Thanks guys!
10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So between this and the new Gimme S’mores. It’s a TIE. I honestly can’t decide which one I like more. But this has been one of my favorites before Gimme S’mores. I love Americone Dream so much The ice cream and the caramel ripple and the chocolate covered cone parts is AMAZING. Whoever said this needed more salt it DOES NOT. It is perfect the way it is. I found no issues with the crunchy part either. It has the perfect amount of caramel perfect amount of crunch and chocolate ratio. This is like a drumstick but with more of that “good part”.
10_bj,2,6.0,4.0,"It would be fantastic if the texture were better and it had something to balance out the sweet. Replacing plain caramel for salted caramel, or adding sea salt to the chocolate. Switching to dark chocolate. The cone pieces felt chewy or doughy, and I expected a crunch. Though I do suspect this has more to do with the freezing process. Id like it a lot more if it was only one of these. While I dont care for it, I can see why lots of people love it. Good job!!"
10_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This one is pretty perfect in my opinion. All the elements work well together and the chocolate covered cone pieces were nice n’ crunchy!
10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I just want to say that now that I have found Ben & Jerrys Americone Dream ice cream, my life now has purpose!! That purpose is to get up everyday, eat Americone Dream ice cream until its gone, drive to the store, buy some more, and repeat. This ice cream is EVERYTHING!!!!!! Please never stop making it!!!!"
10_bj,5,5.0,3.0,Excellent! This flavor has all sorts of things in it!
10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Such good ice cream. Like too good. I cannot physically stop myself from consuming this ice cream. The flavors and textures blend so well together and I am overwhelmed with the need to keep eating it. I am considering seeking professional help. Keep doing what youre doing. All the stars *************
10_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"The vanilla ice cream is so good! Almost as good as my Grandma used to make! I am a caramel lover and could use a little more in this but it was yummy, and of course everyone loves the cone!"

10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Satisfies all sorts of cravings. Crunchier and creamy. Love it while I watch the Steven Colbert show!!!
10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Literally my favorite flavor. The waffle cone prices and magical.
10_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So perfect!!!!!! The caramel swirl is amazing!!!!!
11_bj,5,10.0,0.0,My husband and I loved this ice cream! The subtle bourbon flavor with the pecan chunks was superb!
11_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"This flavor is amazing! Ive only found one store in my area that sells it and I stock up. Ive never been a huge pecan ice cream fan before, but I really cant get enough of this one."
11_bj,5,6.0,0.0,Being from southwest Louisiana we love our pecan pie and ice cream. This ice cream has all the flavor of the south. Always heartbreaking when the store is out of their limited stock of it. Please ship it to my house all year long lol
11_bj,5,8.0,2.0,"I love this ice cream! The first bite always tastes sweet with a hit of bourbon, then add in the nuts, and the short bread, and you have delicious complexity, with a nice crunch."
11_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I love love love this ice cream! Its got a great balance of flavors and textures, and the hints of bourbon are just right. I would eat this all day, every day, if I could get away with it."
11_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Bourbon Pecan Pie Ice Cream cant get enough. The bourbon makes the ice cream.
11_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Excellent ice cream! Whiskey can sometimes overpower all the ingredients--this ice cream has a great balance of flavor and the whiskey is not to overpowering. Here is the problem--I bought this ice cream in an outlet store in California so I fear that Bourbon Pecan Pie will be in the Ben & Jerry flavor grave yard soon. It was a great flavor while it lasted though.
12_bj,5,14.0,0.0,I love Brewed to Matter! So thing about the coffee ice cream mixed with brownie batter and chocolate chunks does it for me. Although I am worried with it being a exclusive flavor it may be discontinued. Please keep this in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"Okay Ben and Jerrys, you can stop making new flavors. This one is perfect."
12_bj,5,10.0,0.0,My girlfriend isnt a fan of this and I think that she is so wrong in every regard that I am writing this review just out of spite and also because this is the perfect ice cream and deserves all of the stars.
12_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"This is by far my favorite flavor, of all time. A decade ago, brownie batter was a flavor that was available as pints and I would get that and eat around the fudge brownie chunks because it was worth it. But this flavor is everything. Please never stop making this flavor! It is the end all be all of flavors. Thank you so much for making this ice cream!!"
12_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I bought this flavor one time at Target because it was the closest one to a java chip flavor, and it changed my life. It was so good. I searched up and down for it though and couldnt find it for a few months in any other store, and since then had moved. I just found it tonight in another target location and jumped for joy in the store. My favorite ice cream flavor by far! Wish it came in a bigger size..."
12_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this flavor. It is beyond perfect and no other flavor can even begin to compare! Unfortunately, it is an exclusive flavor only sold at Target. I’ll buy 2 or 3 when I find them in stock. I will go out of my way to go to target specifically for this flavor and 4 out of 5 times, they are out of the flavor. And the stock guy told me that there isn’t any on order and none coming with the next delivery. Can anybody please help!"
12_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"Nothing wrong here! Yummy coffee ice cream base and a great tasting fudge swirl. The chocolate chunks are a good addition. Not my favorite flavor (I mean, how many favorites can someone have?) but definitely yummy and satisfying if you’re craving coffee and fudge flavors!"
12_bj,4,1.0,0.0,I really liked this coffee flavor! I have tried a few of the other coffee flavors and this one is probably my favorite! There was plenty of brownie swirl and fudge chunks that paired really well with the coffee ice cream! I would definitely try this flavor again!
12_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love coffee ice cream and I usually by a store brand one called java chunk that is similar but once I tried brewed to matter Ill never go back. I love everything about it and I hope it never goes away please tell me this is going to stick around!!!!!
12_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So my favorite ice cream flavor has always been coffee. But my favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor has always been chocolate fudge brownie. This ice cream brings favorites together! Please make this a permanent fixture in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,5,1.0,0.0,A wonderful coffee and chocolate ice cream with a nice mix of flavors and textures. We shop at Target sometimes just because thats the only place we can get it. Our favorite B&J flavor since Toffee Heath Bar Crunch went away.
12_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I make up reasons to go to Target to get this ice cream. It is simply perfect. I keep thinking it will get old and I will switch to my other favs. But I just.... never.... do.
12_bj,5,1.0,0.0,A coffee and chocolate lovers dream in ice cream form. Coffee flavor infuses your mouth as decadent chocolate chunks deliver a dessert worthy of all your money! Love it!
13_bj,2,8.0,0.0,"The cheese cake ice creams could be amazing, but for some reason the one thing wrong with the ice cream is the cheesecake balls. The balls taste very chemical and just not right. Overall I scooped around them. While the carmel flavor really lacked in this ice cream, and the chocolate cookie swirl was very little and almost nonexistent. I am very disappointed with how all of the cheesecake truffles have turned out. Overall, the truffles ruin the ice cream and need to be reformulated. While I am disappointed that this ice cream lacked swirl and Carmel. What could be amazing, was ruined by lack of and truffles."
13_bj,2,4.0,0.0,"The flavors work for the most part. Ben & Jerrys ice creams with the graham cracker swirl are my personal favorites but this one left much to be desired. My main problem are the truffles, in this flavor in particular. The truffles seem to be frozen until you bite into them and then its soft. I cant really enjoy the truffles if Im too worried about the cold shock to my gums from parts of the ice cream being unexpectedly frozen in random places. Im used to thinks like strawberries in the cheesecake to be frozen, but then something like the truffles that should be soft like the cookie dough is frozen, I cant really enjoy it."
13_bj,3,11.0,1.0,"First of all, let me just say that I love this truffle craze that has been going on and made a point to try every option. For this flavor, I love mostly everything about this: the ice cream, the swirls, the exterior of the truffles. However, I do not like the cheesecake interior of the truffles. The cheesecake flavoring is already there through the ice cream, but the cheesecake part of the truffles does not retain the coldness of the ice cream and doesnt fit. I think a chocolate interior would have probably worked better. Would not buy again unless I felt the desire to eat everything but the truffle."
13_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I feel like this remake of the old cheesecake truffle flavor totally snuck in under the radar--and a shame, because its such an upgrade! Where the truffles were the downfall of the old version (no offense, Ben & Jerry), the new cheesecake pieces are exactly what I look for in a cheesecake ice cream mix-in. Theyre not liquidy and greasy like the truffles, but actually have a fluffy chew to them, and they taste great! A couple pieces even had a toasty crust on them. On the downside, the cookie crumble swirls were really thin, but I *almost* didnt even mind, because I came for the cheesecake on this one, and I got it!"
13_bj,5,10.0,0.0,Wow this ice cream is so delicious .. I will definitely be buying more
13_bj,5,10.0,1.0,"First time trying it yesterday.. a little embarrassed to admit i""m definitely going to buy another as soon as Im out of work today! So much flavor but not too sweet, the truffles covered in gram crackers have to be my favorite part"
13_bj,2,10.0,4.0,"See, here is my issue: if I’m going to spend 1200 calories in one sitting on ice cream (and we all eat the whole pint) after working hard to burn enough calories to eat it, I want to melt at the first bite and feel the euphoria with every spoonful, and SO many Ben and Jerry’s flavors do that for me. But when a flavor is just ok, there is no way I’m going to eat it. There was nothing wrong really, with this flavor but I found the ice cream grainy and the flavor boring, and the truffles just didn’t do it for me. I LOVE Ben and Jerry’s, the pints are my favorite ways to spend my calories but I can’t justify eating a boring one. My wife liked it well enough but she wasn’t wowed either. I remember my first bites of Phish Food, Half Baked, one sweet world and so many others that just made me melt into a pool of euphoric joy and that’s what I need from my pints."
13_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Soooooo good! Cookie bits are good! Cheesecake bites are good!
13_bj,5,8.0,1.0,This is the best flavor ben and Jerrys has ever come out with.
13_bj,4,3.0,0.0,"Fantastic flavor. The caramel addition to the cheesecake base makes it stand out far more than B&Js other cheesecake flavors. That flavor is made even stronger by the cheesecake truffles. The graham cracker and cookie crumbs complement each other perfectly, and the overall flavor is accurate to the real thing. Thank goodness the best cheesecake flavor is not a limited batch."
13_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"I am going to completely echo the review of kuroyuuki below. This ice-cream is lovely, the cookie crumbles are nice and sweet, the caramel is perfectly subtle. The Cheese Cake Truffles, however, are almost sour in contrast. Unlike most ice cream ""goodies"" that I dig for (i.e. cookie dough chunks, brownie bits), I find myself trying to spoon around the cheese cake."
13_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"I purchased this ice cream hoping to find a replacement for Cheesecake Brownie since Ben and Jerrys is discontinuing that flavor. I am famous for finishing their pints in one sitting (I know, I am grossly unhealthy). Anyhow, I got through half the pint and had to throw the rest away. Very disappointing."
13_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This is an ice cream I have been waiting to have I always felt I had to choose between strawberry cheesecake, American dream and cookie core, but now I have this! Rich flavor and extremely generous with cheesecake and cookie ratio. It is so smooth! This will forever be my go to ice cream and flavor"
13_bj,2,4.0,1.0,The cheesecake bits tasted weird? Almost tasteless. The other truffle flavor is much better. I ended up throwing the rest of this pint away because I didn’t wanna waste the calories on it.
13_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I recently bought this flavor and was most looking forward to the graham cracker/cheesecake truffle. However, I was highly disappointed with the flavor of the truffle. The ice cream itself tastes a lot like cheesecake, but the pieces themselves do not. I’ve had the strawberry cheesecake flavor before, and those cheesecake pieces, from what I remember, tastes how I feel these pieces should as well. Not sure if I would rebuy, but I’m glad I at least tried it."
13_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"The cheesecake truffles have a horrible taste, they almost taste like plastic. I had to eat around them! Ben & Jerry’s what happened to your awful tasting cheesecake truffles, everything else was delicious!"
13_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"scientists have tried for thousands of years to create the best flavor of ice cream. now, with Ben & Jerrys Caramel Chocolate Truffles ice cream, those scientists can sleep easy. ben or jerry should delete any review that isnt 5/5 stars or higher."
13_bj,1,3.0,1.0,This sounds more delicious than it actually is. The cheesecake bites don’t taste anything like cheesecake. I wish I could have my money back.
13_bj,3,2.0,1.0,"I had to try this because I love cheesecake ice cream! The flavor of the icecream itself with the cookies is amazing! But honestly, the cheesecake bites ruined it for me. They just taste like balls of butter. They are not good at all. If those were changed this would probably be my favorite. Think about it Ben & Jerrys."
13_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream flavor and cookie swirl is phenomenal, but the cheesecake truffles in my pint had no flavor, which was disappointing. There weren’t very many truffles in the pint, however, so I couldn’t even complain much about them."
13_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"This flavor WAS the most amazing thing Id ever put in my mouth. BUT they changed the cheesecake bits and now its just not good anymore. It makes me so sad, I had FINALLY found my emotional crutch! Now, I have nothing again :("
13_bj,4,2.0,1.0,This ice cream is delicious but the truffles are gross kinda...they’re very cheesy and sour in an odd way. make them less cheesy or something and add way more chocolate cookie and this ice cream will be perfect
13_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I ALWAYS keep this stocked in my freezer! Please dont ever discontinue it!! Has all of my favorite things all in one ice cream- cheesecake, caramel & chocolate cookie. SO delicious!!"
13_bj,2,1.0,0.0,The icecream is nice but gets samey after a while. The “truffles” are not pleasant. I actually threw away around 1/3 of the tub...
13_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Love love love this flavor. One of my new favorites, my only criticism would be that I wish there was more graham cracker in it."
13_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I was a bit concerned there would be to much going on but honestly really solid. The cheesecake bites are very nice
13_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"The flavor and texture of the ice cream itself, but the cheesecake pieces are too hard and not up to par."
13_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I ate some of this 2 days ago OMG one of the best ice cream flavors I’ve ever had- IN MY LIFE.
13_bj,1,1.0,0.0,No crazy about cheese cake bites and the rest ok prefer other flavors
14_bj,5,51.0,4.0,"Wow. Just wow. I mean theres nothing better than this flavor. No topping it. Cherry ice cream combined with cherries and chunks of chocolate? Come on. This is the best flavor of all time. Im not saying there arent other delicious flavors that fill me with intense, creamy, passionate emotion, but cherry garcia is home. Cherry garcia is the dog that you cuddle up with on the couch after a long day of dragging your feet through the world. Cherry garcia is the mother that rubs your sweet lil head after the local school bully called your shoes ""dorky."" Cherry garcia is life. Such a wonderful flavor. Im a life-long fan and I will pass this flavor on to my kids, my kids kids, and their kids kids. I love it."
14_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"I’ve held off on this flavor for years. It seemed simple and less than exciting. Ben and Jerry’s is my secret soul food, so when I do it, I pick overtly decadent and rich like Phish Food. I got stuck with this when the hubby picked for me and he loves “cherry” anything. So, needless to say, I was so not happy inside to see Cherry Garcia. I even left it in time out in the freezer a whole day! I pulled it out the next day, fully expecting disappointment. Took a bite or two, and couldn’t stop! This is now my favorite ice cream of all time!! There’s a special sweet balance between the chunks of frozen cherries and giant chunks of frozen chocolate all generously dispersed in mellow vanilla. Every single bite was heaven! But don’t tell my husband! Gotta keep him on his toes!"
14_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"This is my all time favorite ice cream and flavor. For many years we lived in an area that had roadside ice cream stands with homemade icecream. They were absolutely delicious and I enjoyed supporting a local shop, but even having had those flavors I still would choose Cherry Garcia over them all. Its kind of like an old friend, good for the soul. Oh, and the new chocolate cherry Garcia is yummy too!"
14_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"A co-worker bought me a pint of this a few years back. She didnt know I dislike cherry. I hate cherry soda, cherry pie, cherry ice cream, etc. But I tried it anyway, and fell in love. Its the only cherry-flavored thing I like."
14_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"This product is amazing, it is the greatest ice cream flavor to touch my tongue. Anyone that thinks otherwise is wrong. Cherry Garcia is the epitome of ice cream, and that is a fact."
14_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"Two years ago, this was the first Ben and Jerrys ice cream I ever had. Since then I have tried many different flavors, but this one is still my favorite by far. I get a pint of Cherry Garcia at least once a week!"
14_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This was the first Ben and Jerry flavor I had outside a scoop shop, in a pint at home. It’s got great cherry flavor in the ice cream itself and the cherry chunks themselves are great tasting and very plentiful. The fudge seals the deal and makes this a regular in my freezer!"
14_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"Ive eaten this flavor for a decade or more. Its definitely my go to, but, if I could change anything about it I would change ratio of cherries to chocolate in favor of cherries by at least 8:1. If not more. Honestly Id say leave the chocolate out period but I know thered be war. I just cant get enough of the cherries. And sometimes I get a pint thats almost all fudge chips & no cherries. Frustrating. But its still the best current flavor."
14_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"First, Im not the greater fan of cherries, and Im really bought this pint only for trying something new."
14_bj,2,2.0,0.0,maybe i had a bad batch. but the “cherry ice cream” had no cherry flavor at all. it tasted like pure milk with just chunks of cherry throughout. and then bits of fudge flakes. they just tasted like pieces off a dark chocolate bar. i guess this flavor is just not for me
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"IBe tried multiple flavors of Ben n jerry ice cream but nothing compares to this flavor. It’s so perfect with the right ratio of the creamy vanilla ice cream, chunks of dark chocolate (which I know might make u standoffish but trust me it goes amazing together) and the amazing juicy cherries. Every time I go to my local store I grab a pint because it’s just so delicious you always need to have it near by!"
14_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"We have been purchasing Ben &Jerrys Ice Cream for decades. Have tried many varieties, and have a few we buy regularly, but Cherry Garcia is my husband and sons all time favorite!! We purchase an average of one per week of this flavor. Over the years its always been pretty consistant in taste and formulation, however the last few pints we purchased had much less chocolate chunks. One pint seemed to have a few chunks only on the bottom of the pint. My husband said ""WHERE ARE THE CHOCOLATE CHUNKS??"" Happened to the chocolate""??? We think it must have been a fluke in manufactuing and we caught a bad batch as we purchased both pints in the same store. We had this problem with the lack of chocolate chunks in their Cherry Garcia slices, but untll now, never the pints. In ""fairness"" I am giving this product a high rating because this issue with the lack of chocolate chunks has only been with the last 2 pints we purchased, and overall its a good product..."
14_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Too much of a maraschino cherry flavor for my taste. I would prefer more of a fresh cherry taste. That being said, I can see how others would like it assuming an appreciation for maraschino cherries."
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"TO DIE FOR oh my god I love this ice cream I buy it for my boyfriend all the time and i’m how he found it and also my best friend , I introduced it to her too I love this ice cream :^"
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Always on my shopping list. Favorite flavor of any brand. large cherries and big chunks of chocolate always make me smile. perfect after breakfast, lunch or dinner snack."
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My all time favorite, I love the chocolate chunks with the cherry! It’s too hard for me to try new flavors because my eyes always go back to this flavor!!"
14_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I first tried this not very long ago (almost a week ago), and I was very pleased. Love the singing cow on the pint :)."
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I cannot get enough of Cherry Garcia. Been my go-to since I was a kid.
14_bj,5,2.0,1.0,it is so good and you should buy it because it tastes so good
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Cherry Garcia is my go to when Im feeling down and out.
14_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Long before I discovered the GD I was eating CG! <3
15_bj,5,5.0,0.0,I was having a really horrible day. Had received some depressing news about a medical procedure I had to have. In a fit of anger and depression I bought this as a comfort food since my usual choices of Karamel Sutra and Urban Bourbon werent available. And wow. It seriously was so good that it took the edge off the anger and actually made me forget about my stupid health insurance issues for a good 45 minutes. It made those happy brain chemicals kick into gear better than sitting in a room full of puppies. Thank you for making an otherwise crummy day just a little bit better <3
15_bj,5,34.0,5.0,"Ben and Jerry, “Chillin the roast Truffles,” THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! You have been able to make a coffee flavor icecream with actual coffee flavor, and the coffee liqour truffles? are you kidding me?! Deliscious. This flavor ice cream has just bumped into my #2 containered ice cream and i don’t make these decisions lightly. Well done ben and jerry, well done. its not just about the stuff you put in the icecream, the base flavor makes it, and you hit it out of the park with chillin the roast."
15_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"I recently bought this a week ago and have already bought 3. I was most surprised at the authenticity of the coffee flavor. The smooth and [satisfyingly] rich chocolate swirls were a perfect combination when mixed with the ice cream. The chocolate covered truffles were just an added bonus to the already delicious product. My 22 y/o girlfriend who does not enjoy drinking coffee itself ""too much"", also loves this ice cream flavor. 1000/10 (not a typo) would recommend to any coffee lover and non-coffee lover alike."
15_bj,1,16.0,5.0,"I was super excited to try this new flavor, Ive been a big Ben & Jerrys fan for over 25 years. The cold brew coffee ice cream is actually quite tasty and the chocolate fudge swirl is fantastic. But the truffles are absolutely horrific and Im picking them out as I eat through my pint. They taste like this very bad chemically bourbon flavored ball of nastiness. I dont even know how to describe it they certainly dont have any coffee flavor to them at all it really does taste like a fake chemically flavored alcohol additive. Disappointed and a complete waste of money."
15_bj,5,8.0,1.0,"I almost did not buy this flavor in my weekly shopping selection because it had “coffee” in the flavor. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE coffee. But all the “coffee” flavor ice creams I’ve ever had are an injustice to coffee. They’re not well balanced in the flavor, it’s all the same across the brands. BUT THEN I tried this ice cream with coffee flavor and the liquor, coffee etc, whatever all is in this makes it absolutely delicious. My store is out of it - I’ve checked 3 stores! I hope it’s not gone forever!!! LOVE THIS FLAVOR!"
15_bj,3,18.0,10.0,"There were things I liked and some I didnt. Firstly, I really did enjoy the cold brew coffee ice cream. It wasnt very sweet and was strong of coffee flavor, which I liked. If youre a fan of sugary coffee, this probably wont be for you. The fudge swirls tasted good as well, but there wasnt enough in my opinion."
15_bj,3,6.0,1.0,The ice cream itself is really good. Strongest coffee tasting ice cream Ive had from Ben and jerrys. The truffle part is disgusting though and there isnt much of a fudge swirl. What I mean by much is nun at all basically.
15_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"Absolutely delicious l, intense coffee flavor with a nice undertone of the liquor."
15_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"Not bad, but the other Ben and Jerry’s coffee flavors are better, in my opinion. The ice cream was very good but the truffles were too strong for my taste, and a little strange. The chocolate swirl was also a little too intense. You can definitely taste that it’s cold brew as opposed to regular coffee and it’s impressive that B&J was able to capture that difference. No amateur ice cream makers, this group."
15_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I had two or 3 pints of this before not being able to find it. It’s my new favorite after Coffee Heath Bar changed its ingredients and was no longer irresistible. The coffee flavor is a little different, not as sweet — and the truffles, true to their name, have a liquer flavor. Wonderful combination if you love coffee! I guess on one hand, I’m relieved not to be eating it regularly since losing weight has been easier, but I miss finding it on my grocery trips...please restock!!"
15_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I actually really loved the coffee flavor of this ice cream. My usual favorite is Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz, but I can only ever find that in scoop shops (which I rarely patronize). The Chillin the Roast Truffles was available at my grocery store so I pounced. It has a taste that people who enjoy dark roast coffee, plain cold brew, black coffee, or deep espressos will enjoy in my opinion. A lot of coffee ice creams just have a very mild coffee flavor you can barely detect beneath the plain sugar and cream flavor. This was true coffee and tasted excellent."
15_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I bought it last night at Target, and I really enjoyed it! Its so yummy! the truffles were delicious & coffee liqueur really hit me, eating it slowly is the best definitely will be returning to get more"
15_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Bold coffee flavor (more espresso bean than cold brew, I think, but I like it.) Thick fudgey truffles with a lovely top-shelf bourbon flavor. Oh my oh my. This is one delightful ice cream. Not for those who do not like whisky or strong coffee, but perfect for those who do."
15_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this flavor. I am actually currently going back and forth between the caramel chocolate cheesecake truffle, and this one. If you LOVE Coffee, youll love this. When you hit one of the truffles, it is like an explosion of delicious coffee liqueur on your tongue-and you get a little crunch from the cookie crumble, which all fits perfectly together. It is perfect for curling up and watching the latest episode of your favorite show, or even movie night."
15_bj,5,2.0,0.0,First of all everyone should try ice cream flavors at least twice. I never pass judgement till I have something more than once. I am kot a coffee addicted and I have to say that my significant other love this flavor. Great balance of flavors in the ingredients.
15_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Wish all stores that carry Ben & Jerrys have this flavor. I stopped going to my go-to grocery store just because they dont carry this flavor. This might be my favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream. I like how it it not too sweet.
15_bj,1,5.0,2.0,Just a misfire. The candy pieces are terrible tasting. Did not enjoy. Your boozy flavors tend to be bad.
15_bj,3,4.0,2.0,"I love the coffee ice cream but would like more chocolate swirl and no truffles at all. The truffles taste horrible. i can’t even describe what they taste like because I have never tasted anything like them. Rework it minus the truffles and I’m in but until then, it’s a no for me."
15_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Decadent flavors not only with the coffee but the liqueur taste. Definetly and adults sweet paradise. Once you’ve had it nothing will be the same. A+++
15_bj,2,3.0,2.0,"Let me just say first off, this ice cream was absolutely delicious. I mean I LOVED it, until I found out that there was alcohol in it. I don’t drink alcohol and I wish there was some sort of warning on there. It didn’t taste cooked off (I hope it was)"
15_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"my new fav, its perf, dont know what them haterz be thinkin"
15_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The cold brew ice cream was delicious! BUT the truffles were appalling. They were WAY to sweet and bitter. Just overpowering and offputing to where I couldn’t even finish half the pint. I’m a big coffee lover, but this ice cream was just a fail. Probably my least favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor I’ve tried thus far."
15_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This has easily moved up to my new favorite! The icecream has a strong coffee flavor, and the taste is bold. If you dont like strong flavors it may not be for you. But for someone who has coffee in her veins it is perfect. The truffles and chocolate liquor and fudge swirls put it over the top!"
15_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Just bought some Chillin the Roast and love it, would not change a thing. The ice cream tastes just like cold brew coffee so naturally you should enjoy coffee if you are buying this. The coffee liqueur-filled truffles are really good and are the perfect pair to the cold brew coffee ice cream."
15_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Wow this was surprisingly terrible. Only are a few bites and didnt even want to eat anymore. Cant imagine how anyone would like this.
16_bj,2,5.0,1.0,"Always have loved your chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, my husband knows this and came home with some. Well it takes very little to excite me these days but after a day of errands, housework, homework, dinner then getting son to bed all I kept thinking of, was that small tub of heaven in my freezer. So finally I put on some Guilty pleasure reality television snugged into my couch with my favorite blanket and my favorite ice cream only to notice that after a couple spoonfuls......NO COOKIE DOUGH! This can’t be correct NOOOOOOOOO!! First I was really doubting I was smarter than a fifth grader and now NO COOKIE DOUGH! Not the ending I needed to this day!"
16_bj,1,26.0,11.0,Mine does not look like the example photo... there was barely any cookie dough! I basically just paid over £4 for a tub of vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing.
16_bj,5,14.0,2.0,"Ben & Jerrys Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I always appreciated the rich vanilla ice cream and chunks of flavorful cookie dough (the dough isnt dry and flavorless like some other cookie dough ice creams). Sometimes you dont want a busy ice cream with too many extras and this is perfect. I usually go into it with the goal of only eating half the container, but always end up finishing it in one sitting. Classic, reliable, and delicious."
16_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Ive eatten this ice cream before, considering its the only non dairy i enjoy. I have gotten this as my favorite one out of the flavors so many times and never have i had this happen. Its good till november 13 2020. Todays date is july 2019. As you can see in the photo below....its just vanilla with cookie dough bites in it....WHY!? Im not that upset it still tastes good. I just hope it was processed right and not a recall of some sort and still put out on shelves."
16_bj,1,9.0,1.0,"I NEVER review anything, especially not food. But I live in Canada where this ice cream can run up to $10!! Wayyyyy more than other brands but you hope to get what you pay for. There was one small piece of cookie dough on the top, zero other pieces in the entire tub. The texture was weird and icy. Ive had the same kind before and it was way better. With a brand this $$$ a consumer expects consistency. I will be switching to another brand from here on out."
16_bj,1,9.0,0.0,"I just opened a pint of this last week and was disappointed in the quality of the cookie dough. Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, mine had enough of the cookie dough, but the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick."
16_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"Ben and jerrys cookie dough has always been my favourite Ice cream, hate to admit but I can eat up to 3 tubs a week = £15 a week! My last 3 tubs have been disgusting, with an icy texture and the dough bits crumbly and biscuit like as opposed to the usual doughy texture. Will not be buying again as 3 times for this to happen is more than enough. I have the full 3 tubs in the freezer as they were completely inedible, ready to take back to the retailer to complain tomorrow but Im guessing they are going to take it up with you guys."
16_bj,1,11.0,4.0,"After trying B&Js for the first time (Half Baked which was absolutely DELICIOUS), I became a recent fan and had to come back and try their Cookie Dough flavour. Well, what a complete waste of money! I am well aware that B&J has always been more expensive than other ice cream brands (especially living in Australia) but have always been happy to pay more for a premium product. Little did I know, I would open my tub to discover next to no cookie dough in the whole thing! Whats the point of having a couple of teeny millimeter specks? Why pay more for this product when you can get perfectly fine vanilla ice cream from a competitor at a lower cost?! My last experience with Half Baked was amazing but now Im personally unsure whether I will repurchase a B&J product again as I dont want to repeat this experience of buyers remorse and utter disappointment."
16_bj,1,4.0,0.0,"I love Ben and Jerrys chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It helps me relax after a rough day. But, the most recent pint I bought the cookie dough was hard and brittle and dry? I dont know how to describe it but it was weird and not the norm. Even the ice cream itself had a chalkiness to it. So disappointing since its a splurge to purchase Ben and Jerrys as a grad student on a budget."
16_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"I love Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough. I just crushed yet another pint of it and yet again, I loved every spoonful of it! The ice cream is rich and delicious and the dough globs are ridiculous! So good that I eat it with a toddler spoon so I take smaller bites. My goal one day is to combine a pint of this with a pint of chocolate fudge brownie for a double half baked!!"
16_bj,2,3.0,0.0,"I rarely indulge in Ben & Jerrys, but when I do, I go for the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Unfortunately, my most recent experience was less than satisfying. The pieces of dough felt like they were missing a few ingredients. Instead of having that really amazing soft, chewy, dough texture... they tasted like dough powder. It was dry and bland. Did the formula change or are you guys still having issues with manufacturing?"
16_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Not sure what the bad reviewers are on, but give me two please! This stuff is the real deal. Ive literally tried all the other brands of Choc Cookie Dough and in the trash they went. I buy maybe 3 of these a week at least. Too hard to walk past. B and J is all that and more. Love you guys and your product! ps. theres always plenty of cookie dough, must be a factory issue. Ive always had it packed full of dough and its been a long time.."
16_bj,2,4.0,2.0,"I usually love Ben and Jerrys and buy it for a special treat. Today I bought the Cholcoate Chip Cookie Dough and was sooooo looking forward to the promised ""Globs"" of cookie dough. Sad to say in the whole pint (yes, I planned on eating all of it) there were only 7 smallish balls of cookie dough... overall, the taste of the ice cream is great however, the experience became a game of hunt and peck rather than the enjoyment I was looking for. Next time Ill opt for Brownie Batter Core, lol."
16_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Maybe its not the most exciting flavor, but the contrast of the plain (but very good) vanilla ice cream and the ambrosia-like cookie dough chunks makes this flavor one of the most enjoyable to eat. You just have to beat the temptation to dig out every bite of cookie dough before you eat the rest of the ice cream! Ive tried many kinds of cookie dough ice cream and this has by far the best cookie dough (and ice cream for that matter) of all of them."
16_bj,1,4.0,2.0,I have purchased the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough multiple times so dont even try to tell me its due to a particular manufacturing problem. There is barely any cookie dough in the 500 mL pint. It is a total waste of my money.
16_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"I was so disappointed by the chocolate chip cookie dough. There was hardly any cookie dough, the texture was gross and the ice cream was solid as a rock which made it very difficult to scoop and eat. I wont be buying that again, especially at that price!"
16_bj,5,5.0,1.0,Best ice cream like seriouslyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
16_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Ben and Jerrys never disappoints. I have had the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in both NYC and Burlington, Vermont, and both were nothing short of amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but the cookie dough portions were generous and the vanilla ice cream added some nice contrast. :)"
16_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"The cookie dough chunks in this, are very rare, or actually really inconsistent. I wish there were more chunks of cookie dough. Overall, this is by far the best tasting cookie dough ice cream. The cookie dough is good, its just that sometimes I have 10 cookie dough chunks and once Ive had 2 pieces. I just wish there were more globs."
16_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"The vanilla ice cream is rich, creamy and has a strong vanilla the taste. I cant complain about the quantity of cookie dough because half the container was cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cookie dough was dry, crumbly and crunchy. I expected the cookie dough to be chewy and fresh, maybe I just got a bad batch."
16_bj,3,2.0,1.0,"Ben and Jerrys made this flavor first, so theyre well known for it. Its a not horrible flavor, its kind of just there. My biggest complaint with this is that there isnt enough cookie dough, and I dont think its because of some mistake in the manufacturing process. It kind of tastes like vanilla ice cream with the occasional chunk of dough. You could seriously improve this flavor if you increased the amount of cookie dough you put into these pints."
16_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"This purchase left me very disappointed. It was as if I purchase a pint of vanilla ice cream. I didnt come across any cookie dough until after I was halfway through the container. At this point, I didnt eat any more ice cream but wasted the rest of the ice cream searching for the cookie dough. I doubt I will make this purchase again."
16_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"I like many others who wrote reviews am very upset about the lack of cookie dough in this cookie dough ice cream. My pint of ice cream had 4 pieces of cookie dough max. I expected better from Ben and Jerrys. I could have paid less for a different brand and got way more. But I thought they were the best-of the best, I was wrong."
16_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The first time I bought a pint of this I was over the moon with the ratio to cookie dough to ice cream to Chico chips, but as I kept purchasing I noticed there was less and less cookie dough/chocolate chips and more ice cream. This is disappointing and it’s kind of a waste of money to buy 6 dollar ice cream when you aren’t getting what you’re buying."
16_bj,5,3.0,1.0,The Classic Ben and Jerrys. This is the best of all flavors and shall forever be.
16_bj,5,3.0,1.0,Everyone knows Ben & Jerrys is the best. Lets get real here.
16_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I loooove this, flavor I buy it all the time. I recently found out a friend of mine is pregnant and she stopped eating it. I’m just curious if the eggs in the dough are raw? Or is it safe for pregnant women to eat? If so I could let her know and she can eat as much as her heart desires. Thanks!"
16_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"I’ve been buying Ben and Jerry ice cream off and on for years. I’m referring to the last year I have been purchasing your cookie dough ice cream. Although it never contained the amount of cookie dough consumers were led to believe it did in the advertised pictures or descriptions it still contained more and better tasting cookie dough than other brands I have tried. I was pleased a lot times in the beginning, but I still would have liked to see more cookie dough. Also with most of the cookie dough being toward the top and very little or almost none further down was another disappointing factor. I also find consistency to be all over the place."
16_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Cookie dough is my all time favorite flavor no matter what brand, so I have to thank yall for inventing this. That being said, this is hands down the BEST out of them all! Nothing comes close to this, you can tell the cookie dough could make actual cookies."
16_bj,5,2.0,1.0,i love that flavor! I am 10 years old i just got done eating some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream 15 minutes ago. I visited the factory in Vermont in August. The chocolate chip cookie dough i had 15 minutes ago was from Ben and Jerrys
16_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Not sure what luck everyone else is having but mine always has plenty of dough. Its really good dough! And the icecream doesnt taste plain, its very vanilla flavored, almost like a vanilla bean icecream."
16_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"So sad that I decided to break my no ice cream streak with this particular flavor. There was barely any cookie dough, and even less chocolate chips. Waste of the $8 a pint costs in NYC."
16_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"Got a pint for cheat day, and there was not a single cookie dough pellet in the entire pint. It was plain vanilla ice cream with about 15 chocolate chips in the whole thing."
16_bj,1,2.0,1.0,Not a single piece of cookie dough! Very frustrating! Especially at the price of Ben & Jerrys!
16_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Tasted like Just really sugary Vanilla Ice Cream, I couldnt taste the cookie dough gobs."
17_bj,1,23.0,10.0,"He past three times I have bought the chocolate fudge brownie flavor the brownies have been hard and crumbly. The soft chewy brownies and the best part and three times now I have been let down. Each purchase was made several months apart, hoping the quality control issue was fixed. Nope. They were purchased and Walmart twice and Walgreens the most recent time. This was my absolute favorite ice cream flavor, but I think I’m done wasting $5 on being disappointed each time. Ben and Jerry’s, please figure this out. I saw that you commented that this happens when the ice cream melts and refreezes. You really need to contact your vendors and get this worked out."
17_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"I’m dealing with an ice cream addiction right now, I’m eating a pint of chocolate fudge brownie everyday, I know it’s crazy and expensive but it’s the only coping skill that works for me right now, I just love love this ice cream."
17_bj,1,22.0,6.0,"I am so sorry to say goodbye to one of my favorite indulgences. In the past, I have made milkshakes and malts out of this ice cream because its flavor was luscious and indulgent. Sadly, what I purchased today at my local grocery was not. Instead of yummy, chewy, chocolatey brownie bites; it contained gritty pellets of yuck. Each pellet was fairly uniform in size, and unfortunate in taste. Maybe some day I will be able to get this memory behind me and step foot into a Ben and Jerrys shop and see if their ice cream looks something like what is shown in the picture. Then again, after what I tasted today, maybe not."
17_bj,2,17.0,1.0,This is our favorite flavor and the last 3 cartons we’ve purchased have had the same issue of the brownie being crumbly and gritty. We love this flavor so we’re hoping this can get resolved soon! here’s a photo of what we’re seeing in these last 3 cartons.
17_bj,1,54.0,16.0,"Chocolate fudge brownie is my absolute favorite! A few months ago a bought a pint and there was only one giant hunk of hard crumbly brownie in the center, I couldnt even eat it. I was disappointed but thought it was a freak thing. Since then I have tried it again from different stores, and different flavors i.e. Half baked and the chocolate fudge brownie pint slices. Again the brownies have been crumbly and chalky. And there werent many brownie pieces in the them or any fudge swirls. I hope they change the brownies back to the way they were so I can enjoy my favorite treat again!"
17_bj,1,17.0,4.0,"So disappointed! I struggled with gestational diabetes and was unable to indulge in sweet treats for my whole pregnancy. When I gave birth to our sweet baby boy, I was allowed to have my Ben & Jerrys again. The store was out of half baked so my husband brought me fudge brownie. Couldnt even get through a proper bite because the brownies were just a crumbly/icy mess and the ice cream was sticky and solidified. I thought it had expired but its good until Sept 2018! I was so upset. Im afraid to have him go buy more pints if this is the result. I keep hearing about their new flavors but I waited 9 months for a regular pint and it was thrown in the trash-my husband couldnt even stomach it and he eats everything."
17_bj,5,15.0,5.0,"This ice cream is the best chocolate ice cream in the world, now I am a chocolate lover and I also love ice cream i love trying new flavors and also new restaurants. Ever since I have tryed Ben and Jerrys ice cream I never thought i would find another ice cream that would beat it, and you know what I have not found a better one... and I probably never will. I am only 25 but I have traveled ALOT. I lived in Amsterdam for 3 years and I have tasted and tryed many different chocolate ice creams all arownd Europe and nothing even comes close. I am now back in the US and I still have yet to find a better ice cream. ❤️❤️❤️ If your in a chocolatly mood and need a fix Ben and Jerrys is the ice cream for you!!!"
17_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"The brownies! My god the brownies are so GOOD! I’m sorry some don’t enjoy them but I just ate my second pint of this flavor and it’s become a favorite. The ice cream is rich and delicious of course, but the brownies are ridiculously good! Just the right flavor and chewiness. I could eat this for days on end. Please keep this one alive!"
17_bj,5,17.0,2.0,I love the brownies in this ice cream. I’m fact I love them so much that I bought a batch from the company Ben and Jerry’s uses! I eat this flavor more often than I should admit and I LOVE it. Chewy yummy brownies in delicious chocolate ice cream! Can’t lose. I’m sorry so many of you don’t like these new brownies but that just leaves more for me!
17_bj,3,7.0,0.0,"This flavor used to be a favorite of mine, but the last few times I have purchased this flavor over the past few months, no matter what store, the ice cream itself has been great...but the brownie chunks were dry and crumbly! I had purchased Half Baked as well, and the brownie chunks were AMAZING!! I hope something can be figured out so it can be a return to being in my good graces again!!"
17_bj,1,7.0,0.0,Im huge fan of Ben & Jerrys and normally Im a Phish food gal! Decided to try this Flavour as had 7 year old nephew staying and Brownies are his favourite desert also any excuse to indulge in a major choc feast! but was SO disappointed in this ice-cream ! was clumpy and brownies where so hard and dry?!!! Shame a let from all the other flavours ..boohoo.
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Every so often Id buy a pint of ""CFB"" as my kids and I refer it, and the brownies would be hard, crumbly, and tasteless....a real disappointment. I just attributed it to ""a batch that melted on the way to the supermarket"" or something. However, now, when we really need it, I bought 5 pints, and all are hard, tasteless and crumbly. I cant believe that I have to say ""bye-bye""to B&Js CFB."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Ever since I was young, this has always been my favorite ice cream. Ive always bought this ice cream and ate it as a comfort food. However, recently ive found that I cant enjoy this ice cream like I used to, because of the disgusting little chunks of hardness in the brownie bits. Theres nothing more insulting than biting into a ""great baked good"" and instead having your teeth grit because of the inability to chew the extremely hard pieces in the brownie. I thought maybe it was a one time thing, so I bought another container. The second container had the exact same issue. This is truly a major let down, because this is the only store bought ice cream Ive ever liked I hope they can fix this issue soon."
17_bj,1,3.0,2.0,"I have had this flavor from time to time pretty much since it was first made available, so I am familiar with the level of quality it can have. In fact, take a look at your pic compared to mine--totally different experiences as your pic represents what I am accustomed to enjoying and mine is a poor copycat version with crumbly bits of what appear to be and taste like inadequately mixed brownie pieces. Honestly, the ice cream would have been better without the add-ins. After reading other customers experiences, I think I am going to write this one off my favorites list."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"My girlfriend and I got some of this ice cream all because it’s her favorite. She dug into it to find dry, gross brownies. We were like what? Went and bought another thinking the first must have frozen wrong or something. She dug into it and it as well was the same way. I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. I will go out of my way to get some. But now I’m rethinking this. The reviews go on and on for several years worth. If you don’t fix a problem that’s been on going, how am I sure the rest of your ice cream isn’t going to have problems like this. Sorry but I just can’t chance it."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"This has always been one of my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavors. However the last two times I have bought it, the brownies have been crumbly and not fudgey?? Not sure what happened to the batter but the brownies are flaky and hard chunks. Very disappointed!"
17_bj,1,8.0,4.0,"Had a huge craving for Ben & Jerrys Chocolate Fudge Brownie Ice Cream. I have been eating Ben & Jerrys for quite some time now. Today I purchased it and must have bought a bad batch. The ""fudge brownie"" pieces were dry, crumbly, and tan in color-not like usual! It didnt taste like the normal batch either- I was so sad because after 2 bites I just couldnt handle it anymore. I just bought it today and it wasnt even close to the Expiration date either. Disappointed :("
17_bj,2,8.0,1.0,The chocolate ice cream itself is very good but the last couple pints Ive bought all had hard brownie bites. Theyre so dry they crack as soon as you bite into them.
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I normally get Half-Baked, but I was craving actual chocolate ice cream (which is kinda rare for me; I prefer vanilla), so I asked my husband to get me some and he showed up with this. Omgosh. Its better than Half-Baked! Usually I want more brownies in the HB because it always seems (to me) to be 2/3 cookie dough and 1/3 brownie. And this really hit the spot. The only problem is...I ate the whole pint in one sitting, which is, uh, not something I typically do and definitely not healthy. lol. Ill be sure to stop at least halfway through next time. :)"
17_bj,1,4.0,0.0,"This flavour used to be my favorite ice cream of all times, but the last few pints I bought were really disappointing. Bought in CVS, the brownie bits were really hard and dry, and they used to be so moist and soft!! So sad. RIP fudge brownie :("
17_bj,1,18.0,8.0,This was my favorite flavor and the last few pints I bought were very disappointing. The ice cream is delicious but the what use to be fudgie brownie bites are now hard can crusty. Like they are old and frost bite... so sad :(
17_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"Since I was a child Chocolate Fudge Brownie was my all time favorite ice cream until one day I bought it and the brownies were hard, crumbly, gross...I hoped it was a fluke yet every single time I buy it its still disgusting. I stopped getting it for a while and switched to Half baked....the brownies were hard AGAIN even in that. Now Ive been forced to buy other brands but none can even compare to what once was the best ice cream known to man. Sadly not anymore."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was hoping this was a fluke thing but reading the other reviews it seems not. I’ve purchased 3 pints in the last six months or so and they were absolutely delicious! Soft chewy brownie pieces and wonderful ice cream. However this time the brownies are awful. They are rock hard rectangular chunks I can barely scoop out and when eating them they are just dry, hard, and crumbly. Not worth the $5!!!! I probably won’t try again as this seems to be an ongoing issue for other customers as well. It was my favourite ice cream:("
17_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"I bought a pint of this ice cream from my local drug store and I just have to say how utterly dissatisfied I am on the quality of the ice cream I have been eating this brownie flavor for the past 4 years with no problem and I have always been a loyal customer of Ben & Jerrys so Im sad to say that for the first time I am very unsatisfied hopefully youll be able to make it up. And to pin point the problem area, the brownies were burnt and dry."
17_bj,3,6.0,2.0,I have been buying this for a long time but its not the same anymore. you guys have the best chocolate ice cream but the brownies have totally declined lately. I know you can blame retailers but that doesnt cut it anymore. its not their fault. Take the heat yourselves and do something about it.
17_bj,1,4.0,3.0,"We bought 2 pints last night, chocolate fudge brownie and coffee toffee crunch. We havent had any Ben and Jerrys in a few years. Chocolate fudge brownie used to be my absolute favorite. We each tried one bite and all hated it. The brownies were hard and the ice cream tasted really weird. The coffee toffee crunch wasnt much better. I guess they changed the ingredients. Doesnt taste like a premium ice cream. Its not even as good as a cheap ice cream! Definitely wont buy again!"
17_bj,3,3.0,2.0,"This has been my favorite flavor since it came out. However I’ve recently switched to different flavors because the consistency is very bad regarding the brownie chunks. I understand the issue regarding handling but if you cannot control the quality of your product through your vendors, well that’s concernjng for your product. I look forward to the company regulating handling so I can come back to my beloved flavor. Meanwhile, your other flavors are definitely keeping me busy!!"
17_bj,2,4.0,1.0,"This ice cream used to be my absolute favorite!!! Now every time I have gotten some the brownies are hard and crumbly. Ive even tried different stores, different states and now we are stationed in Germany and we still get the hard crumb brownie :( I miss the yummy fudge brownie"
17_bj,1,3.0,0.0,Certainly not worth $8! never again.................
17_bj,3,3.0,1.0,"I buy this ice cream a lot. I notice that half the time its perfect, lots of big chunks of brownie. The other half, its hardly any brownie, or its a whitish color in the brownie and its crunchy (not how it normally is, which is soft) or the brownie is mushy. So, its a basically a 50/50 shot of getting my moneys worth. I love this ice cream but Im starting to wonder why this happens?"
17_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"I bought this recently and it used to my favorite. I got it all the time but the last two pints I bought the brownies tasted overcooked. I dont know how they let that slip through quality control. Come on Ben n Jerrys, you guys can do better."
17_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"This used to be one of my favorite B&Js flavor (right up there with Peanut Butter Cup and Half Baked), but the last two pints Ive bought have had super dry, over-cooked brownies. So disappointing when you are expecting delicious, chewy, fudgy brownie chunks. Upon reading other reviews, it seems like this is a common issue, so I dont think Ill be purchasing this flavor again."
17_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"The last 3 jugs of chocolate fudge brownie have been very dissapointing. The texture of the brownie havent been fudgy, but very hard and crumbly... The brownie isent even brown, its more a light brown colour .."
17_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"This ice cream is usually very good and chocolatey, complete with soft, scrumptious brownies. However, my last purchase of this specific flavor was very disappointing. The brownie bites were hard, grainy, and inedible. The pint has been sitting in the freezer for months, something that is unprecedented in my house Ben and Jerrys lovers."
17_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"This is my absolute favourite ice cream and hadnt had it for around 6 months - unfortunately the 2 tubs I have bought recently have had light coloured, chalky/crumbly dried out brownie in them - very disappointed :-( the chocolate ice cream tastes ok, just the quality of the brownies seems to have deteriorated."
17_bj,1,2.0,0.0,I love this flavor when the brownie are fudge bu over the last several years about 50% of the time I get the graining yucky stuff that I think is supposed to be the brownies. Please fix the problem.
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I used to get this flavor ALL the time. I loved it. It satisfied all my chocolate cravings.... buuuut... I havent gotten it in a while. Until yesterday. It tasted fine until I got to the brownie part. It felt like it was dried out, hard, and even had a crunch to it. I love the Milk & Cookies flavor (so I guess Ill stick to that), but unfortunately I wont be buying this flavor again."
17_bj,2,3.0,1.0,I bought this and was really excited to try it but when I did the brownies were a weird light brown color and hard. The brownies crumbled into what looked like dirt.
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I dont normally go for rich chocolate flavors, but this is one of my favorites when I do. It has a wonderfully rich, creamy, cake-like texture. Perfect smoothness and a delightful chocolaty brownie flavor set this ice cream apart from most chocolate ice cream. If you have a hankering for simple pure chocolate fudge brownie goodness, then this flavor is for you!"
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"Bought this flavor twice in the last 2 days... Yesterday the ice cream was fantastic ate the entire pint me and my wife. But tonight we had our second pint.. The ice cream had lots of crystals all over it, the brownies were crusty it was so bad i checked the expiration date thinking it was expired. Not very happy considering this is a $5 pint of ice cream..."
17_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I like many flavours of B&J but I tend to turn back to this one. Mmmm... the combination Chocolate Fudge Brownie, some salty potato crisps (and maybe some adulty beverage) is so freaking good a friday night that it can make even the worst of weeks look like a faint crack in some old pants you anyway had thought of throwing away. Mmm mm mmm...."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I loved this ice cream flavor ever since middle school! Now the last time Ive bought it the brownie is crusty and nasty ! It not only is disappointing after I sit down after a extremely long day go enjoy a sweet treat that use to be very delicious- and now its just chocolate with chunks of dry crusty brownie bites !! Waste of money
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Im in shock. Ben and Jerrys has let me down for the second time. They used to have such delicious ice cream! The ice cream itself was good, but the brownie chunks were terrible! They tasted more like a ball of slightly cocoa mostly flour. Even the cheapest ice creams get the brownie chunks to taste like... brownies. Epic fail."
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I have stood by this flavor for so long thinking I just had bad luck but the past few times its been the same! Freezer burn chalky crusty brownies and an all around bad flavor. I can see Im not alone. Ive tried multiple stores and it seems like there is no bias for quality! To bad it really is the best flavor in my opinion
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I always get this ice cream flavor. It is my favorite. I bought it three times within the last month and each time it contiued to disappoint me. The brownies were hard and scarce and the ice cream tasted weird and of chemical odor. So disappointed because it is my favorite flavor and I was a dedicated buyer. :((((((((((((((
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,Used to be my favorite before they released the brownie batter ice cream (RIP).. now the brownies are so gummy that they are unedible! I literally eat the ice cream and spit out the brownies they are so bad :( I wish they would release the brownie batter ice cream again as that was a much better ice cream overall.
17_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Ben and Jerrys chocolate fudge brownie ice cream was once one of my favorite things. A treat that was worth looking forward to. The brownies used to be delicious, now they are dried crumbles of tan funk. I dont buy that the poor state of said brownies is due to a freeze thaw cycle. What happened? Really??"
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"This used to be the best flavor they had - moist and chewy brownies. For the last 10 years, theyve sucked. Every so often, youll get a decent pint, but mostly they are inedible. Ive contacted B&J a few times and they never sent what they promised, Ive stopped buying this completely."
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"This used to be my favorite ice cream, bar none. But every other pint I buy now has the same problem - the brownies are hard, chalky and just BAD. They used to be consistently soft and delicious...think Ill have to stop buying this altogether, though it breaks my heart."
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"Used to love this flavour and I bought a couple pints the other day, there were almost no brownie bits in either of them and the ones that were there were hard and crusty :( if the recipe changed for any reason, please bring back the old one. I love my Ben and Jerrys!"
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I compare all my chocolate ice cream and brownie ice cream experiences off this flavor. I have tried and failed multiple times to find a comparable one that comes close to achieving this greatness, only to come short every time. It is my all time favorite ice cream!"
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I normally love Half Baked and tired this one by itself. Everything about it was disgusting. The brownies tasted old and crumbly, and even the ice cream tasted of freezer burn. You need to take better care of your products. I normally love your ice cream."
17_bj,3,1.0,0.0,This was my favourite because of the brownie bites but lately the brownie bites are not soft and smooth like they used to be. They are crumbly and unpleasant. I have had to change which one I usually buy but I do go back to see if its changed but it hasnt.
17_bj,3,1.0,0.0,This is my go to flavor when I get Ben and Jerrys! Normally its very delicious and the brownies are soft! The brownies in this pint were almost white and I was cautious as to if I should eat them! Im disappointed it wasnt like it normally is!
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive been in love with Ben & Jerrys ice cream since I was 3. Im 16 and Ive tried just about every flavor. My top 3 favorites have got to be Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Half baked, and Phish Food. I will always love this ice cream!"
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I have bought this flavor three times in the last two months and the first pint was great, really creamy and the brownies were soft. The last two the brownies were hard and crusty :( Super disappointing."
17_bj,4,1.0,0.0,I love chocolate ice cream and I love brownies! Putting the two of them into an ice cream flavor together was a genius idea! Its a classic flavor to me and never disappoints! Thank you B & J!!!!
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream itself was good, but most of the brownie bits had white crumbly bits and it got worse the further I went into the pint. Possibly partially unmixed ingredients?"
17_bj,1,2.0,1.0,Wow Ive had so many Ben N Jerrys pints and this one was just rancid. Ice cream left a horrible taste in my mouth and the brownies really dont taste very good :/
17_bj,2,2.0,1.0,Went down to my local store and grabbed a pint always love the chest gooey brownies but they were crumbly dust disappointed because its usually so good
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This Ice Cream is amazing!!! Love the big chunks of Brownie!!! Im a Mint Chocolate Chip nut...Put a scoop of this with Mint Ice Cream and OMG...Heaven!!!
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Really don’t understand why the brownies in the last few pints I’ve bought become so hard and gross?!?! It’s unfortunate and now I’ve lost $$$ :(
17_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I just had it for the first time in a while and the other reviews are correct. The brownies are terrible. The old recipe was much better!
17_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Ive always loved chocolate fudge brownie, but now the brownies are rock hard and crumble. No longer have the soft chewy texture."
17_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is hands down the best ice cream on the PLANET! I could eat this flavor all day every day. 10/10 great job B&J’s!

18_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"Love this! I am a lover of Ben & Jerrys, have been for as long as I can remember and while some flavors are not typically my thing, this one is awesome! With the ice cream you get a smooth, creamy and full bodied chocolate malt ice cream, combined with a beautifully whipped marshmallow fluff type swirl. The ice cream mixed with this smooth heavenly marshmallow swirl would be enough for me but the addition of the cookie crumbled covered fudge bits, its joygasmic! Everything about this is a win, I really hope that this flavor stays around for a long time. If you want a smooth, creamy, satisfying chocolate ice cream....well, this one is for you!"
18_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"Didnt realize there is a Chocolate Shake it and. Chocolate Shake it Truffles. The Truffles version is hands downs better. The difference being that one has salted fudge bits and one has cookie covered truffle bits. The truffles are gooey are delicious. The fudge is dry and chewy. Other than that I love everything else about it, malted ice cream with marshmallow is perfect combo. Not to rich and I can eat a whole pint without being sick! Haha probably not a good thing."
18_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Where to begin. The explosive marshmallows? The creamy chocolate? The chewy truffles?
18_bj,2,8.0,7.0,"Something has gone terribly wrong at Ben & Jerrys. After my 2nd disappointing pint from them I was really hoping for a win. This flavor was incredibly bland. You cant call something chocolate malt just because it is light brown. I could not detect any malt flavor whatsoever and could barely taste chocolate. Even then I think it may have just been the truffles. The truffles were ok and there were plenty, but even the marshmallow swirl was also bland. Sweet tasting and I liked the soft texture but none of the flavors that were supposed to be in this were! Unfortunately I forgot to use my coupon and paid for this junk."
18_bj,3,4.0,1.0,I am eating a pint of it right now and the ice cream is delicious. I wish the truffles weren’t as sparse though and wish there were more marshmallow swirl. I’m about halfway through the pint and can still hardly see any marshmallow.
18_bj,2,9.0,8.0,"This one missed the mark for me. I understand the texture is meant to be more like a milkshake but I expected something different and it felt grainy. The flavor was bland for me, almost no milk chocolate flavor, closer to sweet cream. Even the marshmallow swirl was nothing like the Smores swirl, it had a very artificial texture. The truffles were pretty good, but not as much cookie crunch as I expected and there werent many of them. Overall, Im disappointed. I love Ben and Jerrys but this one did not live up to the label."
18_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Ive been obsessed with Tonight Dough for years and have yet to find a new flavor that I like as much until this one! I loved it! Tastes like a chocolate milk shake, love the marsh-mellow swirl and the cookie covered truffles were amazing, I just wish there were more in my pint. It seemed like I only had 4 or 5 but clearly there should be a lot more based on the photo. Anyway, its still amazing."
18_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"I was very excited to try this flavor, and although it was good, it isn’t as good as I thought it would be. The texture of the ice cream is wonderfully creamy, but I would have liked a more intense malty-chocolatey flavor....it’s pretty mild. The marshmallow swirls and truffles are tasty though....except mine could of used more truffles! Overall good but I think I’ll stick with my favorite flavor - peanut butter world!"
18_bj,2,3.0,0.0,"Overall I wasn’t impressed with this flavor, while it is very sweet, there isn’t much chocolate flavor. I don’t care for the fudge morsels either, they’re quite dry. The marshmallow is the best part! I will go back to Chocolate Therapy for my next pint."
18_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"Very bland ice cream and truffles. The only good thing was the marshmallow swirl, of which there was not enough. Only had about 1 tablespoon of marshmallow and 5 truffles in the whole pint."
18_bj,5,5.0,1.0,Creamy smooth Malt ice cream! Need I say more? I think it’s a great idea no ice cream company ( at least in my area) sells malt ice cream so I’m happy Ben and Jerry’s came out with this!
18_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I love everything about this new flavor! I ordered it online and it arrived today. I told myself that I would just try a bit and now I can’t stop eating it!
18_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"I was excited to try this but it fell short. Weird texture, off taste, the truffles were not good. Disappointed! Will stick with my Half Baked from now on."
18_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"the chocolate ice cream was okay.... nothing to rave about, but the marshmallow swirls didn’t taste like anything. the truffles were very sparse, there were only like 5 of them in the entire pint and i wasn’t a fan of the taste or texture. this flavor pint just didn’t work for me. i usually love ben & jerrys but kinda just wanted to throw this one out while eating it."
18_bj,2,3.0,0.0,The truffles were extremely bland. The ice cream & marshmallow swirl were good but it was just lacking in overall flavor & chunks
18_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I had to try one of the new flavors, they looked so tempting! The ice cream flavor in this is so delicious and tastes like youre drinking a malt milkshake. Theres a lot of marshmallow (my favorite part) and a good amount of truffles, not TOO many but certainly not sparse. I will definitely purchase again, but only after I try the other two new ones!!"
18_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I found this flavor yesterday after not buying ice-cream in a while. IT IS AMAZING. It tastes like youre eating a perfectly made milkshake. Theres a little bit of some dryer flavor in the chocolate-cookie covered fudge but it levels out the entire flavor (one of the gripes I have with half baked is that it is too rich / gooey) and the marshmallow swirls tie it all together. Please never get rid of this and if you do let me know so I can stock up forever.
18_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Bought this a few days ago after finally finding it again. Maybe I built the flavors up in my head but for a Ben and Jerrys flavor, this seriously lacked. I LOVE malt, marshmallow, and truffles but it was just so bland. I tasted no malt but the ice cream was really creamy. The light chocolate taste was nice. The marshmallow was pretty consistent with every other flavor that includes it. Im a major fish food fan. The truffles were what I had been looking forward to the most. I really liked the ones in the chillin the roast flavor. The truffles in this though had NO flavor! The only chocolate hint I tasted was from the thin coating; definitely not a ""cookie crunch"". Needless to say, I was disappointed. It wasnt bad. I mean, I love ice cream! I just really wish there was a real taste. If I wanted to vanilla, I would have gotten vanilla."
18_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Picked up about 10 various flavors the other day and ""Chocolate Shake It"" was by far the worst. It was awful! Kept thinking it would get better as I ate, but gave up and tossed the last half away. Ill stick with my ""Tonight Dough""."
18_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"The malt ice cream flavor is good, the cookie truffles are what brings the whole ice cream down. The truffles are bitter and too big. The size keeps it frozen and hard. The marshmallow swirl is amazing though. Then again why not just have the Phish Food which I think is similar but has the caramel to make it even better."
18_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I was extremely excited when I bought this icecream, and don’t regret it, the only thing I did not like about it was the chocolate truffles. They were extremely hard, and I felt like they were unnecessary in the icream. Other than that, the icecream was great, the taste was amazing, the marshmallow was great. 50/50"
18_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"What an awesome new flavor! First off, it really does taste like a chocolate milkshake. It’s light and creamy with the marshmallow swirl and the truffles are yummy too. Good job on this new flavor, B&J! Yum!"
18_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"My least favorite B&J flavor ever! The truffles were almost ""whiskey"" tasting, strong and bitter. I couldnt even force myself to try and eat it. First time I have ever thrown ice cream away."
18_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is not very good, overall. Its just basic chocolate ice cream with a few dots of marshmellow fluff with these really mealy truffles that taste like nothing- very disappointing."
18_bj,4,1.0,0.0,i loved the chocolate and marshmallow. thought i found the perfect flavor but the truffles tasted off and were too heavy compared to the consistency of the rest of product.
18_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love malts so this is so delicious! The truffles are good too along w/ the marshallow bits. Its my favorite B&Js flavor & I hope it never stops getting made :D
18_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I’m hoping this flavor doesn’t disappear because it’s the best I’ve ever tried. Love all the yummy marshmallow creme and decadent truffles!
19_bj,5,11.0,0.0,Got this as one of my cones for my halfy birthday! Great for chocolate lovers! Very rich. Cookies add a nice crunch.
19_bj,5,8.0,0.0,"This is the flavor that won my heart by Ben and Jerrys. If you are some one who loves chocolate and/or chocolate ice cream then you need to try this because this one does not disappoint. You will want to be multiple pints because one pint just wont be enough. I could easily eat pints and pints of this deliciousness in a single day and I am not exaggerating. It really is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had. They could have aptly named this one Brownie Batter because it really tastes like frozen a brownie. This is for all of us chocoholics out there. Thank you, Ben and Jerrys and please never discontinue this flavor! You have shown the rest that you are the best when you created this flavor."
19_bj,5,18.0,0.0,"Oh my god! If you love chocolate this is your ice cream and if you need a chocolate fix, this is your ice cream and if you’re not sure if you love chocolate this will be the ice cream to ensure you do! Up there with Chocolate Fudge Brownie and phish food, this is a new favorite of mine. So silly good I could eat 2 or 3 pints in one sitting. Please do not retire this one anytime soon and if you do, please give us lovers of the flavor some time to stock up."
19_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"I tasted this ice cream for the first time last month. Since then, Ive been hooked! It has all of my favorites into one. I love chocolate chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding and chocolate ice cream. Please, never change this recipe or discontinue it, because its the only therapy I need! :)"
19_bj,5,14.0,0.0,"This ice cream is exactly what its title implies - therapy through chocolate, only way cheaper than therapy. The chocolate pudding is amazing and it is so delish you really only need a few bites to hit to spot. My favorite chocolate ice cream of all time!"
19_bj,5,12.0,0.0,I tried this for the first time a few months ago and it is perfect when you need a chocolate fix to make you happy:) It is so creamy then you get the chocolate cookie swirl. I shouldnt admit it but I have at least once a week.
19_bj,5,8.0,0.0,Seriously the best chocolate ice cream Ive ever had.
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Wow wow wow! I have found, along with a handful of others, another favorite! Amazing! This IS THE quintessential chocolate ice cream for chocolate lovers. The pudding and cookie swirls: totally out of this world chocolate flavor. My phish food and chocolate fudge brownie have competition! If you love chocolate, buy this pint. It won’t disappoint! Sorry for all the exclamation points but I’m serious, you need to be eating this."
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Finally, a chocolate ice cream that is decadent, dark, and not too sweet. The pudding ice cream is an excellent touch and I love that the ice cream is not too milky. The chocolate cookies are a nice touch, although unnecessary to my enjoyment of the experience of eating this wonderful ice cream! Thank you for making a flavor for those of us who believe the only ""real"" and ""tasty"" kind of chocolate is dark chocolate!!"
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"The level of chocolate this product will bring you is mind and body saturating. If you need love and you are lonely or female and suffering that time just put yourself in the bliss of this ice cream. The pudding ice cream is spiritual. You might need to eat this ice cream away from others, where they cannot see how it makes you feel. You may not be ready for how it makes you feel."
19_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I bought this on a whim because I was craving Chocolate Ice Cream. Its now been 1 1/2 months and my husband and I have eaten no other ice cream except Chocolate Therapy. We hope they never stop making this flavor. Smooth, rich without being overwhelming, great pudding texture and flavor and wonderful little fudge pieces. It doesnt get any better. Also, its the absolute perfect pint of ice cream for when you have your period, or youre just grumpy and watching movies."
19_bj,5,4.0,0.0,So rich in chocolate and has texture throughout the entire pint with loaded chocolate cookies! I get at least a pint every week! Short and simple ingredient list and pretty great nutritionally for all that you get. Thanks Ben & Jerrys!!
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"My hubby brought this home for me from Albertsons. I probably wouldnt have picked this flavor myself. I usually go for chocolate with lots of stuff in it, nuts, caramel, whatever! It looks simple but the flavor is bold. It tastes like real chocolate, rich and flavorful. Better than any other chocolate ice cream Ive had! My teenage daughter agreed, it is delicious!"
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I eat this every night. I calculate calories throughout my day to allow for my Chocolate Therapy.... every. single. night. They laugh at me when I check out at the grocery store - I buy all they have in stock. The intensely dark chocolate, coupled with the cookies and pudding are the perfect way to end the day...every. single. day."
19_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This is THE flavor I never knew I was missing. My new favorite. PLEASE don’t ever retire this!
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I dont usually like chocolate, but on the few emotional times when I crave it I want real chocolate which Ive never seen in an ice cream before. This ice cream is heaven! Chocolate so rich you would think it was gourmet. The only thing that could make this better is to make it even darker."
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"My teenaged son: ""Mom, whats that?"" Me: ""Chocolate therapy ice cream... my favorite."" Son: ""Can I try it?"" Me: ""Sure, but save me some."" Later, my son walks into the kitchen with a spoon and the empty pint in his hand. ""Sorry, Mom. It was just too good to stop."" And it is."
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I was craving chocolate ice cream and I decided to stop by Ben & Jerrys. The young lady was sweet to offer samples and I chose Chocolate Therapy. Im so glad I did. Its really rich but I ate the entire scoop. Ive only had Ben & Jerrys once. This was a special treat.
19_bj,5,3.0,0.0,A very satisfying chocolate ice cream combination! But I havent been able to find it in the grocery stores near me. What is happening? Theyre still being made right?

19_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This is the ultimate adventure in chocolate, can not buy any other flavor since trying this. Ben and jerry should win the Nobel peace price for ice cream for this flavor. Guess there is a heaven, I visit it during every bite."

20_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"It has literally been about a decade since Ive had chubby hubby. I went to the scoop shops and they said it was discontinued, this was a few years ago. Well, I begrudgingly made peace with it a while ago. There was always that small voice in my head that said to check the freezer in my grocery store (this is over about 4 different states Ive lived in), alas, no dice. Tonight, I have been reunited with my best ice cream best friend, I was at Walmart picking up a few things and that little voice said ""just look for it"". So I did, and there it was. I stood there in pure amazement for a good minute. Never give up hope."
20_bj,5,7.0,0.0,That if something happened to this flavor of ice cream I would die inside. This has easily become an addiction and I forewarn everyone who dares try it Ive been on the hunt for it at every store near me trying to get the sellers nearest me to keep it in stock instead of only Cherry Garcia which I personally a peanut butter pretzel fudge loving person am not very fond of. If this ice cream Chubby Hubby was in fact a Chubby Hubby he would definitely be my hubby of choice. So a huge thank you to those coworkers the pranki. My only complaints are where and what is up with the Froyo version! Please attend issue as soon as possible
20_bj,4,5.0,0.0,"I just had my first pint of Chubby Hubby and I thought it was great! The ice cream flavor is delicious. Since my first experience with this flavor was after the change from peanut butter filled pretzels to regular pretzels, I can’t speak to that (though the filled ones do sound great) but the chocolate covered pretzels in the new pints are great! The reason I am giving my review 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn’t get any chocolate peanut butter swirl until the very bottom of the pint. I can imagine that if it had been dispersed throughout, it would have been AMAZING! Still, I will get another of these in the future."
20_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"Why tinker with perfection? It appears that Ben & Jerry have changed their ""formula"" for their classic Chubby Hubby flavor, and in doing so have made it far worse. The ice cream used to be fuller and creamier, with peanut-butter filled chocolate covered pretzels and scrumptious robust chunks/gobs of peanut butter. Indeed, quite decadent! Now the ice cream is more ""watery"" (almost like skim milk), the pretzels are no longer filled with peanut butter, and the peanut butter is simply thinly swirled. The result: a pale comparison to its former self; not as rich, not as tasty. Tastes very generic now. Skimping... a sign of the times... Will not be buying again."
20_bj,4,3.0,0.0,"I just bought this flavor for the first time in two or three years because I was so upset about the change in pretzels a few years back. While the current pretzels are better than the round ones you had for a while, they still dont compare to the yummy peanut-butter filled pretzels of yesteryear. There must be a way for you to source these?? Pretty please?"
20_bj,1,5.0,4.0,"I just tried this for the first time and was so excited to find a new ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate! Ive never before found an ice cream flavor I just didnt like (and my first job was selling ice cream, so Ive tried a lot!). I wanted to love it, but after a few bites, I found one of the pretzels, and it was so salty! I thought it was a fluke, but I soon found another that was worse. It took a few minutes for the salt to dissolve in my mouth. Now I LOVE a sweet/salty combination, but I would have gotten less salt licking our Michigan winter roads. I hope this was a bad batch, but I wont be taking my chances."
20_bj,3,21.0,4.0,"This used to be my very favorite ice cream in the whole world! Whats NOT to love? But not anymore. The chocolate-covered pretzel pieces are unsatisfactory. Although the pretzels do not taste stale, their consistency feels chewy and stale. They used to be peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets covered in chocolate - a crunchy triple delight! I no longer buy this ice cream. :-("
20_bj,5,12.0,1.0,"I have a tough time finding this flavor, and thank goodness for that, because I find it impossible to put it down whenever I get it. This has been one of my favorite flavors for at least 17 years now. BTW, those gym bills keep getting sent back, marked ""return to sender"" - am I using the wrong address?"
20_bj,5,5.0,0.0,I had this flavor for the first time a few months ago after finally tracking it down and its AMAZING. Definitely in my top 3 right behind Cinnamon Buns and Peanut Butter World. My pint had over 15 pretzels in it and I was very happy. Only suggestion would be to make the pretzels into peanut butter filled pretzels!
20_bj,1,5.0,0.0,"I bought this last night, and was disappointed when I bit into a giant pretzel cluster that it was half salt. Needless to say I was forced to wash my mouth out a bunch, and lost my appetite very quickly."
20_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I cant remember the first time I tried Chubby Hubby, but from the moment I did, it has been my hands-down favorite ice cream flavor of all time (and this is quite an honor of distinction, as I love many different brands of ice cream and their flavors!). Theres just something MAGICAL about the formula of malt vanilla ice cream, with just the right amount of peanut butter and fudge swirling through, and the crunchy chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets embedded within---this combination is something close to ice cream heaven!!! Love digging into the pint, savoring the rich ice cream, and uncovering those awesome chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets---like mining for gold. Please, Ben & Jerrys, NEVER EVER discontinue this AMBROSIAL flavor!!!! And THANK YOU for providing me with such a great experience through your ice cream!!! :)))"
20_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is hands down my favorite ice cream on the planet. I guess Im fortunate that I almost never find it in stores, because i cant see it without buying it. A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&Js). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer; I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!"
20_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite flavor, tried it for the first time about 2months ago."
20_bj,2,1.0,0.0,Wanted to try this since it seemed like a popular classic flavor. Sorry to say it was disappointing to me. The pint I got contained mostly chewy pretzels instead of crunchy ones. It also seemed that there were peanut pieces that were chewy. I liked the crunchy but the chewiness was an odd texture.
20_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"We just recently it found chubby hubby at Meijer yesterday and my husband got excited because its his favorite ice cream. We just ate it and it wasnt the same. The pretzels are supposed to be filled with peanut butter, not coated. I personally couldnt taste the peanut butter at all and the pretzels were too chewy. We will probably not be biting this flavor ever again."
20_bj,4,3.0,0.0,this was my favorite up until the pretzels were no longer filled. it gave the ice cream that soft texture nw it has too much crunch and will never be the same. still good but not great and can never find it anywhere lately
20_bj,2,3.0,0.0,Bring back the old pretzels or find a new peanut butter pretzel cause these chocolate covered ones aren’t the same. Changes the ice cream completely so people don’t buy this flavor anymore

20_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"The last time I had Chubby Hubby was when the pretzels were filled with peanut butter. I then tried it again and found no peanut butter in the pretzels.

20_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"....the very best! Malt ice cream, peanut butter, fudge and pretzels...yowsa its amazing! My only complaint is that it can be difficult to locate! I stock up whenever I find it though! Thanks Ben & Jerry for the most fabulous ice cream, ever!!!"

I often go on extended diets, and they are almost bookended with a pint of Chubby Hubby. Its honestly one of the only things that keep me going in life. The crispiness and the saltiness of the pretzel, combined with the sweet and chewy peanut butter swirls. Its just incredible."
20_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I LOVE this flavor! Only ice cream I will buy at the store for the past 6 years now I even got my family hooked on it as well. A lot of people are mentioning the pretzels, but I love the extra crunch. There is already a peanut butter swirl and a little peanut butter goes a long way since it is a strong flavor. Thank you for making this ice cream and please please please never get rid of it."
20_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My husband and I have been buying this ice cream flavor for about 6 months now. We are obsessed with this flavor. Chubby Hubby ice cream is addicting.

Thank you for this yummy delightful flavor!

21_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"I was sad to give a mediocre rating because I really loved the flavor of this ice cream. I have never had banana ice cream before and B&J does it perfectly. The addition of walnuts and chocolate pieces makes this flavor simple but delicious. Maybe it was an isolated incident, but my pint had very few chocolate pieces. I think I was averaging 1 chocolate piece for every 4 scoops of ice cream. Thats not great, especially since the image on the label shows it being riddled with chocolate. I am hoping this was an isolated incident and the next chunky monkey pint will be better."
21_bj,5,17.0,2.0,If I didnt know any better I wouldve thought this flavor was made with love and some type of witchcraft- its that good! ❤️
21_bj,1,3.0,2.0,"This is my favorite ice cream ever! I buy it by the pint and in a Chunky Monkey waffle cone whenever I can find a B&J store. I was shocked to find only banana ice cream, not one walnut or piece of chocolate."
21_bj,5,13.0,1.0,"I tried this flavor for the first time a few months ago, and albeit Im not much of an ice cream person as it is, I CANNOT stop buying myself a pint each week! It is SO SO good. The banana base is perfection! I honestly dont even need the walnuts and the chocolate, although the walnuts are absolutely amazing in it... They completely NAILED the banana ice cream. Just....wow. <3"
21_bj,5,9.0,0.0,Tried this flavor today I was unsure about the bannna flavor but got it anyway it is so good. Bananas flavor was perfect wasnt overpowering the chocolate pieces were good tastes like good quality chocloate. I will get again

Ive notice less chocolate chunks and the ice cream has a gritty texture. Not sure why the disparities but I look forward to going home (Jersey) for Christmas. I have a suggestion, PLEASE consider selling in half gallon or gallon sizes. This would make my life complete. Thank You for a delicious product"

21_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I am addicted! this is the best product ever. The only one I purchase. I do not care about the calories because I run them but this icecream is so worth it. I used to make my banana shake with oats and milk...I gave that up to have this. My local grocery store was out so I decided to try the ""Almond Milk"" and I can tell you I was disappointed. The texture was not the same...it tasted like regular chunky monkey but expired."
21_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this Ice cream but I 100% could go without the walnuts, I dont really like those in there, I feel like the walnuts should be replaces with a lot more chocolate chunks. Breyers used to sell a banana ice cream with chocolate chips when I was younger but discontinued it and I was so unhappy! But this one is great, but again, a lot less walnuts or removing them completely would be great."

21_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"First Ice cream flavor I had ever tried.. and wow. All I can say is this is nothing compared to any other Ice cream companys Ive tried throughout my childhood years till now. All though I can say is I do wish It had a great price where other buyers are able to afford it such as myself. But overall, I think this flavored Ice cream should be one of your GREAT classics."
21_bj,3,1.0,0.0,This is honestly my top favorite flavor ever but I wish the chocolate and nut chunks were smaller... when chocolate freezes it gets even harder to chew and it hurts my teeth so I usually eat around the bigger pieces and just eat the smaller ones!
21_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"Love this flavor, rarely is banana done right. Only reason it’s not 5 stars is that I feel as though the walnut and chocolate pieces should be smaller so that the ice cream is more easily consumed when it is really cold."
21_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The banana flavor is soooo good but I literally got 2 chocolate pieces which was kind of disappointing. Maybe Ill give it another chance.
21_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I am a chocoholic and will almost never buy any ice cream with any fruit associated with it but I decided to be open minded with this and give it a shot, so trust me when I say that this stuff is absolutely amazing. I was afraid that it was going to have a very strong banana flavor but it doesnt at all. It doesnt taste like a frozen banana or a banana smoothie or the artificial banana you see in popiscles and candy. Instead, the masterminds created a perfect harmony of sweet cream, vanilla, and banana that keeps it from being boring and the texture is out of this world, better than any soft serve i have ever had with its creaminess and density. The only reason i am not giving this a 5 stars review is because i didnt care for the walnuts or the fudge chunks. They could have left them out completely and that would have been perfectly okay with me or have gone with milk chocolate chunks or peanut butter cups. Still, this ice cream is one of their best and one of the best i have ever had and i am shocked to say that about a fruit flavored ice cream. I was so impressed with the flavor that went out the next day to buy another pint. Now I know why its a top seller year after year."

It is bursting with cinnamon flavor and is unlike any flavor I have ever had. I got my Mom hooked on it now. If there is EVER even a thought of retiring this flavor I would have to make a trip to Vermont to talk to the CEO of Ben and Jerrys. It is that good.

22_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"I (embarrassingly) spent about half an hour reading Ben and Jerry flavor reviews before deciding that Cinnamon Buns was going to be my new favorite! Drove to the store and could hardly wait to taste it when i got home and....... I was disappointed :( Although the cinnamon flavor was delicious and definitely there, the cinnamon bun dough pieces that other reviewers were raving about just werent there for me. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly, NOT at all soft and gooey like others have claimed. Not sure if mine was a bad batch but unfortunately I was very disappointed."
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Hello, my name is Ronny I just want to say how absolutely amazing Ben and Jerry’s did on this one of a kind flavor. When I taste this ice cream. I taste morning breakfast at grandmas with a cinnamon bun in my mouth melting my tastebuds. Ben and jerry all I can say is you succeeded everything and beyond. Thank you for being you and all you do to make these flavors. You always have my support. Never again will I have another brand of ice cream outside of Ben and Jerry’s. Thank you. I love you. Goodnight"
22_bj,2,5.0,2.0,I purchased this flavor after reading how great it was on reddit. I can honestly say I’m very disappointed.The cinnamon bun dough are like gobs of gritty sugar. The caramel ice cream is ok. Almost like eating liquified brown sugar pop tarts. I’ll stick with cherry Garcia
22_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"All I can say about this one is that it’s perfect! The ice cream is great, the bun dough chunks are perfect and the streusel swirl is SUBLIME! I let mine melt for just a few minutes to get it even gooier! This is a great flavor pint and was just a little sad when I finished it."
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Cinnamon Buns was the best ice cream coping mechanism to help me with my dad passing away in August 2018. Its fulfilled my love for cinnamon and is my favorite flavor in the world! As of March 2019, however...I never see it in my area. My college town and my hometown dont seem to sell it ANYWHERE! I actually cried on my moms birthday over it, how embarrassing. It truly is the best ice cream in the entire world. I miss it so much."
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"The first time I tried this was a few months ago and man, have I been missing out!! This stuff is heaven in a little pint.. Im kind of glad these are sold in smaller amounts sometimes.. because its so addicting you almost want to eat the whole thing in one sitting!! I try to make it last but its so difficult! Lol <3 Please do NOT ever think of discontinuing this flavor... cuz its the bees knees! Haha! :)"
22_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I ran to the store to try a new flavor and just opened a pint of this today and was disappointed in the quality of the buns dough... the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick, also there were big almost sugar cubes between the ice cream. :("
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Look no further, Cinnamon fanatics. This is the flavor youve been waiting for. The gooey swirl will keep you diving back in with your spoon, and if youre lucky youll come up with some cinnamon bun dough too. Ive considered buying an extra freezer dedicated to pints of this flavor. I can only hope it sticks around!"
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Finally decided to try this flavor today and my goodness I was NOT disappointed. That streusel swirl is heaven! And the dough pieces remind me more like giant frozen pieces of crumb topping. Like the kind on top coffee cake with is HEAVEN. I definitely need some warm coffee cake to plop a scoop of this deliciousness on!
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I just tried this flavor for the first time and its my new favorite flavor. Its everything I hoped it would be - from the ice cream itself to the cinnamon swirls, streusel pieces and cookie dough. Absolutely delicious. If you love the rich, indulgent gooeyness of a fresh cinnamon roll youll love this flavor."
22_bj,3,1.0,0.0,I was super excited to stumble upon this flavor. It was delicious other than the cinnamon bun dough bites. The dough had a weird taste and after a few pieces i could only describe it as a black licorice flavor. I mostly picked out the dough pieces and was able to enjoy the rest of the ice cream!
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about this when I bought it, so I bought a backup pint of Americone Dream just in case. I have never eaten a pint of B&Js so fast in my life.....it was amazing !!!!! Keep it coming B&Js.....Cinnamon Buns has officially entered my top 5"
22_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Love, love, love this flavor!! It used to be harder to find, but lucky me it started showing up in more places. This is by far my most favorite ice cream flavor. I never get tired of it and when I do try other flavors although I enjoy them I always go back to my cinnamon buns!!"
22_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"There is nothing I love better than a cinnabon bun. However, for me, this did not translate well into ice cream. Maybe im getting older, but this flavor is over the top sweet for me. And that is saying a lot. Sorry, I wont be buying this one again."

23_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Discovered this flavor in a scoop store in Kingston, Ontario years ago. It became my go to flavor. I would hunt it down where ever we moved to. ;) No other coffee ice cream is strong enough and has just the right balance of chocolate and coffee like this one. Got my niece hooked on it too. Sadly she lives in Vienna, Austria and cant get it. Any way this great flavor can make it to the EU?? Please! Lots of Europeans like strong coffee. In the meantime my niece came to visit Boston, MA this summer and she was very excited to have it again. It was a good as she remembered."
23_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I was so disappointed when my favorite B&J flavor (Coffee Heath Bar Crunch) changed to Coffee Toffee Crunch and the flavor went way down hill. I decided to try CCBBB. It is on beyond delicious. It is how I reward myself after hard work in the garden, or walking with my Mastiff, or other causes for exhaustion or for celebration. When I finished my taxes the first thing I did was grab the CCBBB out of the freezer ..... my reward to myself. I have recommended CCBBB to others and their reactions have been positive. Thank you B&J! By the way --- the Mastiff has to stick to vanilla!"
23_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"I am both a chocolate and coffee lover, and this is the single best coffee ice cream Ive ever tried.

Please NEVER discontinue this flavor, Ben and Jerrys! I stock up every month. :)"
23_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I’ve tried all of the coffee flavored ice cream I can find in local stores and this one is easily the best. My only issue is that’s it’s not carried at many stores and I’ve had trouble finding it in the last month. Thankfully the B&J team assured me it’s not discontinued but the production is behind because of the pandemic. When things are back to normal please get this in more stores so more people will discover this incredibly indulgent and amazing treat!
23_bj,5,6.0,0.0,I bought this after a 3rd shift at work to get me through the rest of morning class at school. Its really quite strong and kept me quite awake!
23_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I adore this flavor. I have become quite a fan of stronger coffee over the years so this one is a winner. The coffee ice cream is definitely strong and just sweet enough. The espresso fudge pieces give a nice texture contrast and are a lot like eating chocolate covered espresso beans. Fortunately there are at least a couple stores in my area that have this one and I hope they never stop carrying it. Please never discontinue this flavor.

23_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I used to purchase a different brand of coffee ice cream and they no longer make it...BUT then I found you! Oh how I love you coffee coffee buzz buzz! I have tried almost every brand of so called ""coffee"" ice cream and nothing even comes close to the strong, creamy coffee flavor of this wonderful ice cream...can you tell how much I LOVE this ice cream?"
23_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This is one of my FAVORITES. I first tried this in the B&J on my college campus and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, when I got home, I couldnt find the flavor anywhere I was bummed. That was about 5 years ago. I never wouldve thought to check the company website. I just thought it was a discontinued flavor but NOPE, I see that for my area theyre selling it exclusively at Target. Now all I need are coupons."
23_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I am literally addicted to this flavor!! I love it!! It’s the best coffee flavored ice cream ever. I know I sound like I’m exaggerating but I honestly mean every word. I buy at least 2 pints every weekend for my cheat meals. Eat like half a pint for the weekend nights. I’ve tried so many other coffee flavors because it’s one of my favorites but this one tops them all the strength of the coffee flavor is the best it doesn’t have that weird too creamy taste it’s just like adding some milk and sugar to a cup of espresso and a side of some dark chocolate which is honestly the best flavor combo ever just pairs so well. And I love the dark chocolate espresso pieces; I used to buy dark chocolate covered espresso beans and eat them and it reminds me of that with the light crunchy-ness of the beans in the chocolate. My literal worst fear is that I go to my grocery store one of these fridays and I find out that this flavor has been pulled or discontinued! If this flavor ever got taken away that would be the worst ever!! I mean I think I buy out this flavor at my store alone and waiting for it to get shipped sucks and is a pain. This is a lot just for a flavor of ice cream but as I said before I love it and I’m addicted to it. It’s the only coffee flavor ice cream I’ll buy. Thank for making it!!
23_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is, by far, one of the best flavors I have ever tasted! Tried it on a whim, not a coffee drinker or lover of coffee, but because the store did not have my normal go-to flavor (NY Fudge Chunk), I thought I would give it a try. Now, I am eagerly searching for grocers in my sons home state so that he can buy it and love it too!"
23_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I live in Taiwan, and we sadly get very limited flavors of B&Js here. However, this one is one Im happy to have. Excellent coffee flavor with just the right amount of chocolate. Im ashamed to say how many pints I ate this summer, when it was just too hot to even go outside (except to the Carrefour store for more ice cream!)."
23_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my all time favorite ice cream flavor. The only downside is that I can eat it all in one sitting! It is so good, my family and I are obsessed. We even travel to get it because it is only available in certain stores around us. Wish it was available everywhere! Truly an underrated flavor!"
23_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Hello from HOUSTON, TEXAS!!! All do B&J ice cream is delicious, but CCBBB has my heart.

24_bj,1,79.0,29.0,"I love coffee ice cream and heath bars, but try to eat them infrequently due to needing to watch my sugar and weight. On a nearly 90 degree day here in NH, I decided to indulge. What a horrible disappointment. The ice cream is ok, but after a few bites of toffee, I was done and tossed the pint. I found myself avoiding the crunch. So disappointing. I appreciate your dedication to non GMO, but I prefer strong labeling. I am a big girl, and can make my own choices. I just wont bother with B&Js if they sacrifice taste. This is not health food, there is no way this variant is any better for you than the Heath version, lets not kid ourselves."
24_bj,1,45.0,15.0,After you changed the formula and removed heath bars from this ice cream it’s tasted awful. I ate this ice cream every day for years when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This new Coffee Toffee Crunch is dreadful. Consumers have been complaining since you made the change and you have not improved the ice cream. I know how Business works so I am sure part of the problem is that you are lock into a contract with the new Toffee company but you are losing sales therefore you should get a new supplier. I keep waiting and checking for you to fix this formula so it could taste like it used to. Very disappointed.
24_bj,1,11.0,0.0,Not sure why a Ben & Jerrys employee responded to another customer that Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch wasnt a replacement for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. On this very page you have a video stating: Coffee Heath Bar Crunch has a new name!
24_bj,1,23.0,5.0,"Anyone who likes this flavor must never have tried Coffee Heath Bar Crunch because this is a sad replacement at best. And yes, I’ve read the multiple replies from B&J staff stating this flavor was not meant to replace it, but as others have pointed out, there is a video on the flavor’s page announcing its ‘new name’. I’ve bought this flavor more than once since its switch years ago, hoping for improvement over time, but still the toffee leaves a terrible aftertaste and the coffee ice cream lacks its once creamy, rich flavor. Ben & Jerry’s commitment to non-GMO products is admirable but please don’t this sacrifice the taste! Bring back the Heath Bar or give us a better replacement!"
24_bj,1,38.0,6.0,"I eat a relatively healthy diet and the coffee/toffee Ben and Jerrys was always my one real guilty pleasure that I would indulge in whenever I wanted something sweet. I admire the companys dedication to non-GMO/fair-trade products as I often eat a diet as low in non-GMO products as I can, but this new product really is dreadful. There is little flavor in the ice cream, and the toffee tastes like what you would expect from a sugar-free candy bar. I have bought it twice now, the first time was a surprise, and the second time was me hoping it was just an isolated mistake. Both were bad enough that I threw them away within a few bites. Major disappointment and I hope they take these reviews to heart and reconsider the product change."
24_bj,1,7.0,1.0,"Coffee Heath Bar crunch has been my favorite flavor of icecream since I can remember. I decided to try the new product because I figured it wouldn’t be too much different from the original. I can’t pretend to eat it. Knowing what the flavor was to this?! No comparison. I read all of the responses from Ben and Jerry’s on this site and they claim that the point was to not replace the product. If it wasn’t to replace why was Coffee Heath Bar crunch discontinued? Have the Non-GMO (I mean, we’re talking about a treat here) and the original one if it wasn’t meant to be a replacement. I haven’t bought a Ben and Jerry’s product since and I used to have my freezer full. Such a disappointment."
24_bj,1,32.0,5.0,"This ice cream is just disgusting. You say you werent replacing Coffee Heath Bar Crunch but you were, I red it at the time. I get the GMO thing but as others have said ice cream isnt healthy and we can make our own choices. You keep telling people it is a manufacturing error ITS NOT the ice cream is just BAD. Why are you treating your loyal customers like this. Fix it or agree that you cant reproduce one of the best flavored ice creams you had. It doesnt make the top 10 anymore but Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was always in the top 10."
24_bj,1,36.0,5.0,"I noticed the name of my favorite ice cream changed in the grocery store today and tried it anyway - I figured swapping toffee bars wouldnt make that big of a difference but the coffee base changed too. Its no longer rich, the toffee no longer produces that sticky liquidy toffee pool. Instead, this toffee melts into a pretty gross dark brown grainy mess. The left over flavor is just yucky. Dont buy this. CHBC is gone and this is not a replacement."
24_bj,1,3.0,0.0,Coffee Heath bar crunch was my favorite flavor.
24_bj,1,6.0,1.0,"I have recently decided to make my way through all of the B&J flavors (I have gone through an embarrassing number of pints embarrassinly fast..) and this was one that excited me at first sight. I love coffee ice cream and I love toffee, so I thought the two together would be a great mix. Sadly, the coffee flavor was very weak, and the toffee tasted almost metallicy. I thought maybe it was just a bad bite, but every piece of toffee had that same metallic taste, and all of the ice cream that touched the toffee was given that flavor as well. Overall, I was highly disappointed, and very saddened because this was the first flavor I have tried that I did not like. I will be throwing away my pint and not buying this flavor again."
24_bj,1,21.0,2.0,"I love coffee, I love toffee, I dont care for this flavor. Strangely metallic flavored toffee. I bought this a few years ago and hoped that it had improved. Well, it did improve, but it still isnt great. It went from inedible to tolerable. This ice cream tasting bad just makes me sad. I dont want a refund, I dont want coupons, I just want this ice cream to taste good."
24_bj,1,5.0,0.0,"I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is disgusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s."
24_bj,1,21.0,3.0,I bought this the other day and was soooooo ready to dig in. Boy was I disappointed. Immediately there was a difference. The coffee has no flavor. It lost all the richness. Oh and the toffee bars. Ugh! Totally gross. This tastes like the diet version. I understand why you guys made the changes and Im glad to support the cause. I guess Ill just have to find a new ice cream.
24_bj,2,5.0,0.0,"Wife and I just bought a pint of the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch because it has been a year at least since we had one. Today was a test to see if maybe had gone back to Heath Bar toffee. NOT. Whatever kind of toffee being used now is, apparently lots less money is the usual reason for change...big mistake. The Heath Bar version, I am betting, far outsold the present blend. The present toffee blend...we did not eat much of the pint, maybe total 3 spoonfulls. The rest...we tossed into trash."
24_bj,1,5.0,0.0,I used to keep track of what stores had the Coffee Heath Bar Crunch for those times when you just need a good pint of ice cream and a movie. Knowing that it isnt out there anymore is sad in a way the surprises me. And its not like an old Atari you can find on eBay. Its just... gone. I didnt hear about the change but noticed it was really hard to find the flavor when I was looking for it. Then I found the Coffee Toffee Crunch and thought they might have just changed the name. Then I tasted it and thought I must have gotten a bad pint. Then I read the label and realized my favorite flavor was gone. I can only hope someday theyll bring it back. Maybe Health Bar can meet the free trade non-GMO requirements? Whats so wrong with GMO anyway? Isnt that just called science? Isnt that how we cure disease?
24_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Maybe its because I had never tried the original. But I love this flavor! It is one of my go tos! The coffee ice cream is delicious and the toffee is a tasty buttery crunch! Mmmm!
24_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"Let me be clear: I want to give this 1 star for how disappointed I am. I threw in the extra recognition because the idea is amazing. I was fortunate enough to try the original with Heath, but sometimes I wish I never knew how heavenly it was. It hurts so much to lose my favorite ice cream flavor strictly due to an ingredient change. The toffee is mediocre and reminds me of the cheap caramel from my childhood. It’s a critical difference from the original, more buttery and crunchy delight. Please, for my sanity, bring back the original flavor or just put this flavor to rest. I can’t take any more disappointment when I see it next to my second favorite flavor, skipping this one every time..."
24_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"Im so upset at the taste of this ice cream that I made my way to youre website just to express my concerns. Okay so I love coffee, especially coffee ice cream. When I stumbled upon this ice (which was in sale) I thought I found a a yummy treat. Boy was u wrong and disappointed. The coffee flavor isnt bad. But the toffee. Yuck. It has like a sour milk metal taste to it. And no its not expired and in eating the ice cream with a plastic spoon. Something is just not right. And with the other reviews, I know its not only me who feels this way."
24_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"I rarely buy B&Js but the CHBC was my fave, so when asked what kind of ice cream I wanted with Christmas dessert it was the first thing I thought of. I could hardly wait! Imagine the disappointment when met with this horrid excuse for coffee/toffee ice cream! I get the whole non-GMO thing, but is there no one making a decent non-GMO toffee bar that you could use? One bite and I knew it wasnt Heath - though I hadnt heard you were making a change. I complained pretty vocally so my sister actually showed me the container to prove it wasnt a generic brand. It was then that I noticed the change in the name. I wish I had known. What a waste! If Karamel Sutra wasnt so good, I wouldnt even look at the Ben & Jerrys section of my stores freezer."
24_bj,1,6.0,1.0,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was one of my favorite ice creams of all time, but I cant even eat this. I get that some people have an irrational fear of GMOs, but that is no reason to manufacture a bad-tasting product. If you really cant use Heath then find some other toffee that tastes good; I imagine it cant be that hard to do. Until then Im not buying this (and since you discontinued most of my other favorites, my overall Ben and Jerrys purchases have been and will be infrequent)."
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,"Awful, metallic, bland taste. CHBC was infinitely better. Although B&J claims it was not a replacement, despite being dished out directly after CHBC was discontinued, it is clear that this was meant to appease CHBC lovers. B&J could not have been farther off in this assumption. This ice cream went straight into the trash after five people took a bite and determined something was ""off"" years ago. It was purchased again recently with the same conclusion. Awful."
24_bj,1,13.0,2.0,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite B&J flavor. Bought this when they first made the change and thought Id gotten a spoiled batch. As others have noted, terrible metallic taste, and the ""toffee"" tasted bad and had the wrong consistency--like a crunchy sponge instead of dense. Have never bought this flavor again."
24_bj,1,7.0,0.0,Today I was daydreaming about the original toffee heath bat crunch. Its been over 2 yrs since Ive had been and jerrys. This flavor was the last one that I ate. It was horrible. Of course I was comparing it to coffee Heath bar crunch which was magical tasting.
24_bj,1,7.0,1.0,"As much as you insist that this isn’t a replacement for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, it absolutely is, and it’s a failure. How did you manage to find the grossest toffee bars on the planet to put in this abomination? And the coffee ice cream— icy and terrible. Awful, and substitution for the old delight that was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch— a flavor to which I would credit my bachelor degree, as it did its part in getting me through college."
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,So coffee Heath bar crunch was my jam. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the toffee used now for this ice cream is really bad and leaves a bitter taste.... so disappointing because the old version was amazingly delicious. I know your comitting to non-gmo products so perhaps partner with a different toffee maker? or make a plain coffee ice cream. B&Js coffee ice cream base is great so I I would just buy that and buy my own Heath bars!!!
24_bj,1,6.0,0.0,"I love the coffee flavors from Ben and Jerry’s and “Coffee Heath Bar Crunch” was my all time favorite so I figured this might come close... and no, sadly it doesn’t. The toffee is grainy and sweet, tastes very little of anything. The coffee ice cream is much less richly flavored, sigh. I had a few bites and tossed the pint."
24_bj,1,6.0,2.0,"I understand what Ben&Jerrys is trying to do, but I no longer have a Ben&Jerrys flavor that I like enough to buy. Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite flavor and I bought it every single week. I tried this new one, thinking it must be the same thing with a new name; However, this toffee is horrible and almost tastes metallic. The taste of the ice cream is completely different. Youre better off just buying a different brand of plain coffee ice cream and adding Heath Bars, or whatever toffee you enjoy, to that."
24_bj,5,5.0,4.0,"I cant believe I am seeing these negative reviews. I am a fan of ice cream in general. I live in Schenectady NY and if anyone doesnt know this where some of the best ice cream in the country comes from. That said... This is my absolute FAVORITE flavor of all time. Awesome flavors. Together! But it is hard to find now and theres similar flavors out there but none with big chunks of toffee in it! Plus the coffee flavor compliments the toffee so well. I usually stick to my local brands, but this is by far one of the best out there!!! Why cant I find it anywhere guys!?"
24_bj,1,8.0,2.0,"I check back every year or so to see if B&J has listened to their customers and gone back to the original Coffee Heath Bar Crunch recipe, but see they’re sticking to their guns on this one. This product used to be perfect and now doesn’t even taste like a treat. I’m shocked that the company would settle for this nothing-like-the-product-it-replaced substitute. Why would non-GMO and fair trade make it taste so much worse? Ben and Jerry’s are in the wonderful position to effect change by CREATING DEMAND for non-GMO and responsibly-sourced ingredients by showing how wonderful they can be: this does the exact opposite and actually hurts their cause. Dumbest business move since New Coke. After 4 years of hoping and waiting, I’m giving up on hope they’ll ever see the light or listen to their customers; This was my last appeal."
24_bj,1,6.0,1.0,"After being a huge fan of the CHBC, I was quite upset when the new flavor came out and still am. The coffee ice cream and toffee bar is absolutely disgusting. The toffee doesnt have the flavor that Heath Bar or Skor does, and the coffee ice cream is also horrible. I asked somebody else to try this flavor after it changed and they also thought it was disgusting."
24_bj,1,7.0,0.0,"Since they dont sell regular coffee by the pint, I used to settle for Heath Bar Crunch. The contract must have expired and they replaced it with some awful generic. Coffee is still good, toffee is inedible."
24_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"So today I tried B&Js Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for the first time two different ways (as is my custom): very firm straight out of the freezer and slightly softened after having sat out a bit. I give this flavor a ""meh"" out of five. The large toffee bar chunks, purportedly fudge covered [shrugging emoji], dont do justice to the coffee ice cream. For me the pinnacle of grocery store coffee ice cream is Trader Joes Brownie Coffee Crisp ice cream sandwiches. If Ben & Jerrys can pint up their version of somethingverysimilartothat, I will probably bankrupt myself when I find it in stores! That combo of soft brownie, small, solid chocolate bites and coffee ice cream is my jam. But toffee slag? Not so much."
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,This is my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor. I have had trouble finding it in my location 65109 and 65101. I love the coffee flavor with the flavor of the heath bar and the crunch of this ice cream. I am gluten free and so may flavors have cookie dough which automatically eliminates those options. Love this ice cream. Please start delivering this back to the zip code locations of 65101 and 65109. I have not been able to find this flavor in Jefferson City. Miss this ice cream which is what prompted me to make this review. Love the ice cream flavor of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch.
24_bj,1,4.0,2.0,"I dont eat a lot of ice cream in order to try and avoid too much sugar. But I wanted a treat and Coffee Heath Bar has always been my favorite ice cream. I picked up a pint and was so looking forward to the indulgence. What an absolute disappointment it was. I originally thought it was me...maybe I had dreamed it up in my head that it had tasted better than it did in reality. I had some more the next day and it still was not good. I had my son try some and he agreed. I was not going crazy. The toffee pieces are just awful. I am all for the non-GMO movement but honest to God, I would gladly take the Heath Bars back regardless. It was a delicious treat that is now a huge let down. I truly hope that I can find some replacement :("
24_bj,1,10.0,1.0,"Wow, eliminating my favorite ice cream for this dreadful concoction for completely non-scientific pseudo-science mumbo jumbo fakery reasons is just stupid."
24_bj,1,6.0,0.0,This is very disappointing stuff. Im sure that the company that makes this tasteless toffee is very happy to have actually found someone to buy it. Whats next...Phish Food with actual fish?
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is digusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s especially at $5/pint."
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"It’s really not hard to make great-tasting buttery toffee candy. I used to do it all the time in my own kitchen, and I liked mine just as much as I like Heath bars. Please find a supplier of non-GMO toffee that doesn’t taste like a nickel-cadmium battery. Geez, maybe I’ll start up my own toffee company and underbid whomever you’ve contracted with just to save my formerly favorite ice cream flavor. (Well, second favorite of all time after Dastardly Mash — yeah, I go back that far.)"
24_bj,5,13.0,5.0,"This is my favourite flavour of Ben and Jerrys. The contrast between the rich coffee ice cream and the sweet crunchy toffee is lovely. My two main grocery stores appear to have stopped carrying it, and that makes me very sad. (I found this site because I was searching to see if Ben and Jerrys had discontinued it.)"
24_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"Would have given it zero stars, if possible! This flavor is awful! The toffee is terrible! I could and do make better toffee in my kitchen. This was a bottomline decision. GMO, Fair Trade blah...blah, blah...blah, blah. Ruining one of the best BnJs flavors was a bottomline decision by the parent company, Unilever. If BnJs was purchased by Hershey, Heath bars would still be in use."
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,I used to love your coffee heath bar ice cream. But then you took away the heath and put in cheap toffee. Yuck!!! You totally ruined my once favorite ice cream by getting rid of heath for cheap toffee. Now I will NEVER by any Ben & Jerrys ice cream.
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,"I have tried the new blend of coffee toffee twice and the toffee is disgusting. Coffee heath bar crunch use to be my favorite flavor, but I cannot even chew the new toffee without gagging."
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,Miss the full flavor heath bar and the big pieces. This is way off the mark leaving a nasty bitter taste from both the coffee ice cream and the toffee pieces. Will never buy this again.
24_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"Coffee Health Bar Crunch was my all time favorite ice cream. When I went. To get a pint and saw the name change I was confused, but figured maybe it was rebranding of some sort, but when I took it home and tried it I realized I was wrong. Honestly, the new toffee is gross and I couldnt even bring myself to eat t.f he pint. So disappointing!"
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,The new chocolate covered toffee pieces are terrible. They taste like ash. This was among my favorite flavors back when Heath bars were being used. Shame it fell so far.
24_bj,1,7.0,1.0,The ice cream wasnt even coffee flavored and the toffee pieces left a bad taste in my mouth
24_bj,1,7.0,2.0,One time my neighbor talked me into licking her metal swingset. It was winter and I was a gullible kid.
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,Decided to try again since I heard changes had been made but the toffee is still not good. Please keep trying!
24_bj,1,4.0,0.0,Not the same since you are not using Heath Bar....I will no longer buy...It was gross...waste of money.
24_bj,5,4.0,0.0,Lover it so much!! Would buy again and again!! Miss the old version but still great!!
24_bj,1,5.0,1.0,"I was highly disappointed with the flavor, much different than the Heath Bar crunch my wife and I loved! We ate a few bites out of this pint and looked at each other the same way, like, what the heck did they do to our ice cream!!! Ugh!! By the way, what the heck DID you do to our ice cream!?!"
24_bj,5,5.0,1.0,"I hear that you may go back to the old recipe. If you do, I hope that you keep this one too! I love it! Some complain about the coffee being bitter, but it offsets the toffee perfectly. Love that toffee too! I have to make a special trip out of town to find it, but its worth going after."
24_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This Ben & Jerrys flavor is dangerously delicious!!!
24_bj,5,5.0,1.0,"I love coffee ice cream and this one did not disappoint! I found it creamy and delicious. There are other brands whose coffee leaves me with kind of a thick disgusting taste in my mouth, but not this one! It was absolutely yummy! As far as the crunch, that part was a nice treat."
24_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This is by far my favorite Ice Cream. I have a very poor appetite and even my doctors tell me I can eat as much ice cream as I want, I usually finish this in 2 sittings. The only problem is that my Giant Eagle runs out of it very quickly."
24_bj,5,5.0,4.0,"I love coffee ice cream, and toffee is my favorite type of candy, so this is obviously a winner for me. Ive seen a lot of criticism about the toffee in this but I LOVE it. Its better than heath or skor in my opinion. Its much crunchier and it has more of a buttery taste. Every time I eat this ice cream I wish that I could buy the toffee itself to snack on, Maybe Ben & jerrys could start making candy too?!"
24_bj,5,5.0,2.0,"This flavor is just so delightful. Robust coffee flavor tempered with the creaminess of ice cream, and crunchy toffee pieces, with bits of gooey goodness as you eat. Its really hard to get the right balance for a coffee ice cream, and somehow you found it! Such a great pairing with toffee! This Ben & Jerrys flavor Ill be returning to again and again!"
24_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I try to be objective but it’s hard because this is the best freaking ice cream ever. Coffee toffee is amazing (and I’m a Mormon) and I will die if it gets discontinued.
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"sorry to say i never tried your ""original"" but recently discovered this version: Coffee Toffee & must say: THANK YOU B & J - i am in love! cannot get enough of THIS flavor. gave up on anything else as a ""sweet treat"" wont be missing any of whatever it used to be. this is my Go-To, Gotta-Have-it ice cream, now & forever"
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I bought this after coming back from a vacation where they had toffee ice cream and was looking for something to fill the void it left, and Im so glad I did! This coffee is not over powering in its flavor, but is enough to make you taste it. The toffee is super crunchy and in big prices scattered throughout!"
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Coffee Heath Bar used to be my absolute favorite ice cream and for years I bought it to the exclusion of everything else. Since the formula changed Ive tried the ""new flavor"" (I get it, ""not a replacement"", sure) a few times and am always SO DISAPPOINTED. The toffee has a weird plastic-y texture and metallic aftertaste. This all natural non-GMO toffee tastes more fake than the good old Heath Bars ever did. And still missing is the absolute best part of the old flavor - the way the Heath Bars would melt a little into the ice cream leaving delicious gooey envelopes around the crunchy candy pieces. How long is B&Js Quality Assurance Team going to ""review"" all this negative feedback before they make a change? At least admit you arent going to do anything, then I can just give up on it altogether."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Honestly, I was shocked when I saw how poorly this rates on the website compared to most of Ben and Jerrys other flavors! I too loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, but this is a totally different product and I love it just as much. If you love toffee and coffee flavors, I think youll enjoy this pint as much as I do. Just dont go in expecting Heath! This toffee reminds me more of a rich, handcrafted chocolate-covered toffee bar youd find at a local chocolatiers shop. And it is so dang good."
24_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Yalls trippin if you think this ain’t the bomb. It’s got toffee, it’s got coffee, it’s smooth, creamy, has a great amount of toffee bits you can nibble on in between scoop sessions or you could save it for last. It doesn’t matter how you eat it it’s still one of the greatest ice cream creations ever to come out of a pint container and into your mouth."
24_bj,5,3.0,0.0,The perfect blend of sweet coffee flavor & toffee crunch! I just wish my local store would carry it more.
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Saw all the negative reviews and was honestly baffled (admittedly, I never had the Heath bar version). I love this ice cream! Toffee is perfectly crisp and didnt get stuck in my teeth (I was a little worried about that going in). And I love the rich coffee flavor of the ice cream."
24_bj,1,3.0,0.0,Nothing like the previous flavor. Wont be buying this one anymore
24_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"I hate posting anything other than a glowing review of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but this... yeah. The coffee ice cream base is excellent, like all their coffee bases, but the toffee, while plentiful, is dreadful! I never had it with the Heath Bars so I can’t compare them; I can only go on this new pint I bought but the toffee is really terrible! I couldn’t eat it, not worth the calories. I bet it was glorious with the other toffee because the coffee ice cream is delicious."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I tried this flavor my last month living in California and fell in love! It is the perfect amount of toffee and the coffee flavor is delicious. I never had the heath bar flavor that everyone seemed to love, but it makes me sad that everyone writes such poor reviews for this flavor. The poor reviews might make this flavor go away all together so please stop with the one stars! Since moving to Texas, I am completely unable to find this in any store in my area and am very sad."
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This flavor is a dreadful substitute and has made me lose my love of Ben & Jerry’s. Coffee Heath Bar was my favorite. I can hardly believe that switching out to this other toffee candy could downgrade this ice cream so dramatically. Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!
24_bj,1,4.0,2.0,"I keep hoping b&j would listen to the feedback and change the recipe again, this used to be my absolute fave flavor but since they changed the recipe it’s no good. I haven’t met anyone who likes it now. So sad I’ll never have that delicious coffee heath bar crunch again. Even if you can’t go back to original recipe, could you at least work on the current one and make it better??"
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,Just bought toffee bar crunch since I didnt see Heath bar crunch. Such a shame the new flavor was horrible compared to the original recipe. The vanilla ice cream was no longer thick and creamy and the toffee bar was terrible. No longer a Premium ice cream. Sorry B&J but I will not be buying anymore from you guys.
24_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"When this was Coffee Heath bar Crunch it was my absolute favorite flavor ever. I ate almost a pint a week. Since switching away from actual Heath Bar, the flavor is incredibly disappointing. The off brand toffee supplier is pretty bad. Theres so much good toffee in the world... I dont understand how B&J managed to find a bad one. The flavor is ruined."
24_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"Used to eat this flavor all the time when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. The coffee flavor ice cream barely tastes like coffee anymore. What did you do? Blech... tastes like watered-down stale coffee that was left on the burner too long. Usually I devour a pint, but this one has been sitting in the freezer for a week ahead Ive tried eating it 3 times now."
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,I was so excited to remember how much i used to love this ice cream (formally of the Heath Bar variety). Then I dug into this new version. SO disappointed. It really is gross. Totally different texture and flavor. Overly sweet but bitter at the same time. Ya’ll need to reassess
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"I guess theyve changed the recipe since I last had it, because I was just disappointed with what I got this time. It used to be my favorite flavor, but it was just bad, with a metallic tasting toffee . Hopefully they havent changed the recipes for all their flavors."
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,We tried this flavor for the first time yesterday (both my husband and I are big coffee ice cream fans) and we both took one bite and spit it out because it tastes SO metallicy! Super weird. We made a friend try it too and she also agreed it tasted like metal. Not sure if an ingredient went bad or if it the recipe needs reworking but probably the grossest ice cream I have ever had. Stilll a huge Ben and Jerrys Fan but wont be buying this flavor again.
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"At first I didn’t like it. But then the flavors took hold of me and I absolutely loved it! It’s my favorite flavor. Unfortunately, it’s harder to find but it’s the best!"
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,I kept thinking my taste buds had changed cause I haven’t had this ice cream in years but no the toffee and coffee are just bland and not at all worth the calories. Certainly a disappointment after having enjoyed the original perfection of coffee and Heath bars.
24_bj,1,4.0,2.0,"The old coffee heath bar was my go to ice cream! NOTHING compared. Went to buy it one day and I hoped it was just the name they changed but boy was I so disappointed that the flavor changed, unfortunately in the worse way! Never bought it again and keep hoping some day it will be back! Glad to see I am not the only one who feels this way!"
24_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"I saw you changed out Heath bars for a non gmo version of toffee, unfortunately I absolutely hate this new flavor. Not sure it just tastes bland and off"
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,I echo the comments of everyone else who is disappointed and frustrated by the change to the recipe. The new toffee bars are not crunchy and I dont like the taste. The ice cream has also lost its coffee flavor. This used to be my favorite flavor but no more. Why hasnt anything changef if you have passing along negative customer feedback for over a year? Id rather you discontinue this flavor altogether than keep making it in its current formula.
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,I love this one. It combines my favorite flavors of coffee and toffee.... enough said. Now PLEASE bring it back to my area!!! Thanks!
24_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"Tried this flavor yet again after Heath Bar was replaced. Unfortunately the toffee replacement is not good. Surprised this is still is a flavor, would prefer you to put it in the graveyard and bring back Chocolate chip Oatmeal cookie."
24_bj,1,4.0,1.0,Please bring back your original Coffee HEATH BAR Crunch!! Very poor substitute. So disappointed.
24_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Delicious. I like it better before they switched from heath bars, but it is still my favorite"
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"Sad to see so many foodies complaining about this flavor in comparison to a previous similar flavor. I do love that the chocolate and toffee texture is not frozen rock hard so I am able to enjoy flavor as it melts in mouth. I’ve been looking for a similar quality in a regular candy bars, no longer enjoying some toffee bars I’ve eaten before. Makes me wonder how delicious this heath bar flavor was to cause such an uproar from others."
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The last time I had B&Js, I thought I was buying my favorite flavor ""Coffee Heath Bar Crunch"". I wasnt paying attention to the change on the label. Starting to eat it and it didnt seem the same. I thought, maybe my taste buds had changed, or something. But, then I read the label and realized why. I havent had B&J since. Now Im reading these reviews, and its not just me. Boy, do I miss my favorite ice cream, well ice cream flavor"
24_bj,5,4.0,2.0,My favorite flavor. Nothing can compare. I probably eat one a week. I was concerned with some of the lower ratings last year before I left for basic training that I would get out and it would be in the flavor graveyard. Lo and behold it’s still here. Can’t get enough of the toffee!
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,My MOST FAVORITE ice cream!! Did liked the heath bar crunch better but now that Im used to this...I love it as Well! The only problem is slowly but surely all my stores are dropping it..:-( There is only ONE Target that I know of that still carries it and its 25 min away.
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I do not recommend this product. Should not even be considered ice cream. The minute you added coconut oil it tastes chalky, metalic and poor texture. Also skim milk; why? This new product has more calories than the original version. Personally, when I choose this brand I expect true ice cream and ingredients. I do not care about how many calories or healther dietary ingredients. Make it the way it should be..."
24_bj,2,2.0,0.0,This is just not what it used to be. It has looonggg been my favorite flavor but the new toffee bar makes it a no-go for me. So freakin sad about it.
24_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This ice cream I was worried wasnt going to meet my expectations...but it did! And the size of the toffee pieces were great! This combo is amazing!!
24_bj,2,2.0,0.0,This used to be our family favorite. We bought a pint almost weekly. But we havent bought it in a few years. Its just not the same anymore. :(
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,I feel like this flavor was made for me! I was astonished when I found it. I didnt realize other people like coffee and toffee too! I adore the toffee bar. Better than any Ive had before! Im eating it as we speak. Thank you! I also LOOOVE the big chunks!!!
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"My wife loved the original flavor. She always said, whens shes pregnant she is going to eat this all the time. Well she got pregnant and there was no more coffee heath bar crunch. It crushed her spirits. Thankfully our local ice cream shop supported us through the pregnancy but the business would have been given to Ben and Jerry. Please bring back the CHBC flavor before we go through another pregnancy."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my absolute favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor! I used to get it all the time, but the stores I went to frequently all stopped carrying it around the same time. I assumed it was discontinued. Imagine my surprise when I moved to NC, and there are actual Ben & Jerrys shops, and this flavor still exists! So excited to get Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch again after years of flavors that just werent the same."
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was very disappointed after eating the new version of the toffey coffee heath ice cream. It was by far the worst Ive ever eaten. The ice cream with the heath bar in it is my favorite. I will no longer buy it due to the drastic flavor of the new toffee. Most people arent buying ice cream at Ben and Jerry prices for their health, its usually to indulge a little bit. So sad to see the change."
24_bj,1,4.0,2.0,"Ben & Jerrys Coffee Heathbar crunch has been my favorite food of all for about 26 years. I no kidding had days where it was all i ate. When i was a paramedic in Williamsburg, VA there was a B&Js store where you made the best even better by being in sundae form, heaven it was! In the military, anywhere in the world I was if I could find some of this ice cream I felt at home. Now however, its not the same. The removal of actual heath bars completely changed the taste. Gone are the treasure which was the little gooey pockets found next to a piece of Heath. I hate to say it, but it actually tastes bad. Didnt know it was possible for a B&J ice cream to taste bad but it does. The chocolate tastes cheap like cheap generic store brand and the toffee tastes & feels stale."
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,I always buy coffee ice cream. I usually buy a pint of coffee/toffee at the nearby coop. The price is 9.99. My husband treated me to your Coffee a Toffee Crunch. The ice cream tasted like molasses. The toffee bits had no crunch and tasted stale. I tried it twice thinking I ate something earlier that would alter the taste. Second spoonful hours later still tasted like molasses.
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,Im shocked by the reviews of this ice cream. Its not the strongest coffee flavored Ive ever had but when paired with the delicious and generously sized pieces of toffee it is fabulous.
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,This was my dads favorite and I like it a lot too. He walked me down the aisle for my wedding in 1996 and his reward was a pint. I cant believe people arent reviewing it higher.
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,I love this ice-cream!! Im from Canada and it also appears that my fav grocery stores have stopped stocking this one. I hope it hasnt been discontinued in the Great White North.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I like coffee ice cream. I like toffee. What could go wrong?? Ahh! Thats right. The toffee pieces are too large, so large its difficult to get a little toffee and a little coffee ice cream in the same bite. Too bad because toffee & and coffee go together like two peas in a pod."
24_bj,5,3.0,2.0,All the negative reviews are crazy. This is my favorite flavor by far! I love the giant chunks or crunchy toffee. No other ice cream maker has anything even remotely close. Youre lucky if you get tiny slivers in other brands. My only regret is that it seems to be caffeinated so I cant eat it too late or it keeps me awake.
24_bj,5,3.0,1.0,Hands down the absolute best flavor made! No other coffee flavor even comes close! The toffee chunks are HUGE and the coffee flavor itself can’t be beat!!!
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I wasnt too sure on this flavor, but my local store at them BOGO half off, so since they were sold out on Strawberry Cheesecake, I though I would try something new. And I found it to be one of my new favorite flavors. I love that the toffee doesnt get stuck in your teeth like a regular toffee candy bar, and the coffee ice cream compliments it perfectly."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the only ice cream im willing to eat. For everyone that doesnt like this ice cream your negative reviews has made it difficult for people like me who would like to find it at the grocery store. im on a ben and jerrys coffee heath bar crunch ice cream hunt and i cant find it. The gas station nearby was the only place i could find it for 6.99 and now they have discontinued it After reading these negative reviews now i see why its slowly disappearing from stores. it is absolutely the best ice cream on the market. my 2 favorite things combined coffee and heath make it easily my favorite ice cream. I would pay $100 to have a bucket in front of me right now, but it is like a mission to find it. i live by smiths in las vegas they dont have it, walmart doesnt have it, some albertsons may have it i think if im lucky but i havent seen it on this side of town since i moved. no ice cream compares to this one. i hope to find a store soon with it. <3"
24_bj,1,3.0,2.0,"I thought Id really enjoy this flavor, like I do with all other flavors or b&j, but this one just doesnt taste good. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was excited to try it, but was very disappointed once I got home only to have it sitting in my freezer ever since."
24_bj,3,2.0,1.0,I have always had a thing for this flavor and finding it around my area is hard. I recently stumbled upon it and was so excited to get home and take a bite. Not realizing they changed the heath bar to a toffy bar I knew something was different : (... I want the heath bar back!!! Its just not the same without it.
24_bj,1,3.0,2.0,I bought this one because I havent been able to find my favorite Boom Chocolatta. I had high hopes for this flavor but the taste left much to be desired. Its quite expensive to pay $6 for a pint and take one bite only to have it take up precious freezer space :(
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love this flavor ice-cream but it is so hard to find I know I might be one of the few that does enjoy it but I dont care i love coffee and the mix of the toffee and crunches it fills my sweet tooth Ive even gone as far as ordering an entire case of this flavor for my family we all enjoy it on movie nights
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite flavor. I hadnt bought this product in a while and didnt realize till I bit into one of the toffee pieces that it was no longer made with Heath bars. I understand their reasoning behind changing the toffee pieces, but this toffee is horrible. Tasted old and very oily. So sad!"
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,My wife loved this back when it used Heath bars but now she cannot stand it. The toffee no longer compliments the whole. Thankfully Americone Dream is unchanged so she still has an option she enjoys. I understand this B&J goal but flavor is still the most important consideration when it comes to ice cream.
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"When I first tried this flavor I instantly fell in love! Coffee ice cream is one of my favorites, and the addition of the toffee brings it to another level. I have had some trouble finding this flavor in stores recently and I’m very disappointed that it doesn’t seem to be carried in a lot of places."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This has always been my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry’s, but it’s hard to find. I enjoyed it with Heath, but this new toffee is much better! It’s more buttery and easier to eat frozen. It tastes like the more expensive English toffee they sell in tins during Christmas."
24_bj,2,2.0,1.0,This used to be one of my favorite flavors. Bought it today and didnt notice the name change. The bars have a gritty texture to them and is nothing like the Heath bars that were used. Disappointed. Really wish I didnt choose this flavor. Wont purchase again.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Are used to love CHBC far that I’ve changed wouldn’t be that different. Boy was I wrong! The coffee flavour is so disappointing and the bar is granny with no nice coffee flavour I am so sad as this used to be a big treat for me and now I’ve had to waste a pint.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,This is the worst thing you could have done to my most favorite flavor of ice cream ever!! This version doesn’t even come close in comparison to Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!!! Please bring back the original...this Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch stuff is awful!!!
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,I found this flavor many years ago when it had Health Bar and I was sad at first when the toffee changed but I have learned to love the responsibly sourced toffee too. I like to try other B&J flavors but Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is my true love!
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,This used to be my favorite ice cream. I keep buying more to see if it will taste the way it used to but ever time Im left feeling disappointed and sorry I wasted my money. Its weird how something that used to be so yummy is now weird tasting?
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I have been on a diet for a while, used my cheat day to share some ice cream with my partner. The “candy” you used to replace the Heath toffee is NASTY, what good is fair trade non gmo terd nuggets, absolutely the last time I buy Ben and Jerry’s"
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Just tried this in desperation looking for my Coffee Heath Bar Crunch fix. What a mistake. The toffee is chalky. Horrible flavor. Cant compare to the Heath Bars they used before. Dont waste your money. Grab another flavor.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,i bought this flavor ice cream today. Its my first buy from the brand. I was ready to dig in. I was disappointed at the flavor. The coffee taste watered down. Not a rich flavor. The toffee taste odd. I didnt enjoy it.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"When it was the coffeee Heath bar crunch it was absolutely stellar, but once they changed it, its really not good. Its the toffee. Its gritty, hard, and bitter which is a shame because the actual ice cream is good."
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I just purchased recently and first time ever trying Ben and Jerry because a co-worker highly recommended and i took about 3 bites and threw it out. It was bad. Doesnt taste anything like what I was expecting.
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite ice cream of all time. You destroyed it. The ""toffee"" is disgusting and crumbly, and the ice cream is flavorless. I dont even buy Ben and Jerrys anymore. So sad."
24_bj,1,3.0,2.0,The newer version is a sad imitation of the original. New toffee is not even close to the flavor of the Heath toffee
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I tried this after they stopped using Heath. Its terrible! I was so unhappy, Ive stopped buying all B&J products. I can appreciate they are trying to improve the products, taste cant be sacrificed."
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Im not sure I have ever been so sad as when this flavour was removed from Canadian shelves. It is my favourite flavour but I cant travel to the US just for ice cream. A nation has been deprived.
24_bj,1,3.0,2.0,"I bought this on sale, and I see why. The bars are good, but the ice cream was the worst B&Js ive ever had."
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I just tried what I was hoping was still my favorite B&J flavor. What have you done? You are creating anti-non-GMO consumers. If avoiding GMO means substandard substitutes, No thank you."
24_bj,2,2.0,1.0,I loved coffee Heath bar crunch but this new flavor is nothing like it. Toffee tastes bad and barely a coffee flavor to the ice cream. Ill probably toss it out. Liked the old flavor better.
24_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"Not sure why so many blistering reviews, its not even as horrible as its being portrayed. I love the coffee and toffee taste. I enjoy ice cream every now and then and B&Js is a good brand."
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,I feel so sick after eating this .. I have tree but allergies and I feel like my throat is closing after eating this.... i am freaking out . This was my fav flavor but what happened ?!?
24_bj,1,2.0,1.0,The toffee choc pieces are tasteless and the coffee ice cream which used to be rich and intensely coffee is more like tea and instead of creamy is frosty-iced pcrystalline. Very sad...
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I don’t understand all these 1 star reviews! This is the absolute best ice cream and the actual toffee is far better in quality and taste then a Hersheys toffee bar. Perfection!!
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,I love my coffee ice cream. And the LARGE chunks of toffee in this provide a perfect crunch without being too hard. I appreciate the size and quality of the toffee. Brilliant.
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this flavour, it is my favourite! I think this is almost as good as it was with the original Heath Bar and appreciate Ben&Jerrys commitment and them being consequent."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,One of my favorites! The reason for replacing the Heath™ bar pieces was in honor of Heath Ledgers tragic passing #RIPHeath...The people rating it a 1 Star need Jesus!
24_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Was once one of the greats, but the toffee bars in this ice cream are no where near as good as the old heath bars were. Sorry; this one was t an improvement."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I purchased this along with my favorite core ice creams just to try it out. May want to have this as a shake in the morning instead of regular coffee.
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Tried this flavor on a whim and I loved it!! If you like Heath or Scor candy bars you’ll love this. There a huge chunks of toffee. Sooo good!!!!
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,The coffee base is creamy and strong flavored and the toffee offers a delicious crunch. Also the perfect ratio of coffee ice cream to toffee!
24_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Not sure if I got bad pint or what, but the ice cream was icy and not creamy at all. the toffee was great!! ice cream more ice than cream."
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,I never had it with the Heath bars so I dont feel like Im missing out. I love coffee and toffee and this flavor is a hit with me!
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite treat. With the change, the ice cream isnt as rich, and the toffee is unappealing. :("
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I had forgotten my rule of not buying this flavor, and now $5 is basically going in the trash because this stuff is inedible."
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,This is my favorite ice cream of all time! The Heath bar bites are yummy chocolatey surprises. Im hooked forever!!!
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"My all time favorite ice!!! If you are looking to try a new flavor, you have to taste this. I absolutely love it."
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Never get rid of this flavor. Finally two of my favorite flavors and ingredients in one place!!!! Thank you
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"This use to be my hands down favorite ice cream, now I wont even buy it. The new toffee taste awful"
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I tried this and went back and bought 4 more pints, my family and I are in love with this ice cream!"
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,This is hands down the best ice-cream Ive ever had. I have no idea why its rated so low...
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Love the huge pieces of Heath Bar. Yummy! Coffee taste like a creamy latte. Great combination
24_bj,5,2.0,1.0,The pieces of toffee bar are just killer. So yum! Might be my favorite coffee ice cream.
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,The coffee flavor is washed out and the toffee is bland too. Sorry you diluted flavors!
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Such a rich coffee flavor. So creamy and huge chunks of toffee
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,No way is this as good as Heath bar crunch. Not even close.
24_bj,5,1.0,0.0,By far the bets flavor! love the big Heath bar pieces!
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I just spit this out of my mouth. The toffee is gross
24_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Seeing this on my weekly shopping tour I grabbed expecting as always a delicious ice cream that I would enjoy with pleassure and a little guilt because I tend to eat the whole Pint in one sitting. Added to that I love everything coffee flavored and Toffee just reminds me of good childhood memories. But this 5$ ""treat"" certainly did not remind me of anything remotly good. I did let the Ice cream get meldet a little and grabbed my spoon and wanted to indulge in. The pure coffe ice cream was passable , a little bit stronger would have been better in my opinion but hey everyones taste is different. What i really was excited for was the Toffee crunch. I grabbed a big spoonfull and tasted a really really big disapointment. It tasted all mettalic and even bitter. I even tried another one because I could not believe it. This was the first time I ever had to throw away a nearly whole pint of Ice cream. Let alone this makes me sade . After that I looked up the flavour on this side ans saw that many other Ben&Jerry fans had the same experience. To sum it all up I tried nearly all flavours and loved them all of course one more then the other but i would never reject an offer to eat one. But this Coffee Toffe Bar Crunch was not only a waste of my money but also a discourage for a huge supporter of the brand . Next time Im gonna think about if I want to buy one of B&Js products or one of a other brand."
25_bj,5,3.0,2.0,"I tried this ice cream for the very first time about a month ago, and now it is my once a month treat to myself. I didnt eat ice cream very often, but Im a bit of a caramel nut. When i saw this flavor, I have in and broke my rule and got a pint, even though I was leery of spending so much on an unfamiliar product. I have a strict budget, and only allow myself to get a ""comfort food"" treat once a month, so that Im not tempted to buy junk food when Im really in need of that ""comfort"" factor. Im SO glad I took the chance! This is the best caramel ice cream i have ever had! My only regret is that out only comes in pint containers."
25_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this flavor a couple of weeks ago and it has now become my all time favorite ice cream! If you love coffee ice creams and caramel this is the perfect ice cream for you! Mixing the cold brew ice cream with sweet cream allows for a much more subtle coffee flavor and really emphasizes the trio of flavors goes together exceptionally well.
25_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is so good that I’m eating it right now. I love Ben & Jerry’s and I love coffee ice cream. So when I went looking for ice cream I went to the 7-11 down the street. Had I known this was going to be so good, I would’ve bought the rest of whatever they had in stock!"
25_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this flavor. We bought one pint and went back for two more, then we showed them to our friends and they went and bought some! The best flavor I’ve ever had."
25_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is so good? I don’t usually like coffee icecream but this is amazing. Definitely has a lot of caffeine, but luckily I have adhd and am therefore immune."
25_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Bought one last week at a 7/11 and saw that they’re exclusive so I had to go back yesterday stock up on a few!
26_bj,1,26.0,3.0,"I have bought this flavor for years and it was my favorite ice cream EVER! However when you changed the recipe and took the HEATH out of it I noticed immediately! I thought I had bought a bad batch, and after a few bites threw it away. After 4 more batches with the same disgusting taste, I wondered why I was eating ice cream that tasted like rusty metal! And sure enough it was the NEW “Toffee Pieces”. They are so bad I can no longer eat this. What a tremendous disappointment. I could eat another brand of ice cream with a rusty spoon and it would taste less like metal than the New everything but the.....NEVER AGAIN!"
26_bj,4,28.0,1.0,"This is my go-to choice every time Im needing a fix. Its close to being perfection in a pint. However, I miss the Heath brand chocolate covered toffee pieces. It just hasnt been the same since the switch. Am I the only one that thinks the current toffee has almost a medicinal or metallic taste? Would love to see a better toffee choice in the future. Thats not strong enough....PLEASE GIVE US BETTER TOFFEE PIECES!!!"
26_bj,4,4.0,0.0,"This flavor is one of my favorites! I fell in love with it the first time I had it, it was packed full of peanut butter cups and huge pieces of toffee. However the past couple time Ive had it I only get shavings of toffee, and a couple peanut butter cups. was there a recipe change? Smaller toffee and more nuts? Fewer PB cups? Ill still purchase this flavor! Just disappointed to not find large toffee pieces and more delicious PB cups"
26_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I got this ice cream for the first time after finding out about Ben and Jerrys no nonsense stance agaisnt white supremacy and was not disappointed! Absolutely delicious, I ate every morsel I could get! The peanut butter cups were massive and delicious, the toffee pieces were really yummy for me, and the white chocolate was not overpowering, as white chocolate can sometimes be, but added a nice addition. I will certainly get this flavor again and am excited to try other flavors in the future!"
26_bj,1,6.0,3.0,"There is a complete lack of ""everything"" in this! Ive had four in a row with no toffee, and very little of anything else. Seriously?? When you pay a premium for ice cream that is stingy, it is not premium, it is a waste of money! Very disappointed! Been a forever fan, but Im done hoping it was a temporary issue, it has been consistently lacking. So sad, but time to say goodbye):"
26_bj,5,3.0,0.0,The toffee isnt nearly as good as when it used to have Heath bars in it - it tastes a little more sour to me. But everything else is fantastic. This is by far my favorite B&J flavor.
26_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"Ben and Jerry’s is hands down my favorite brand! As for this flavor, the ice cream is great, as are the peanut butter cups, but the toffee is not good at all. I never had this when Heath was used but I can imagine it was far better. The nuts were ok but I won’t be buying this flavor again. Others are far better. Sorry, folks."
26_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"This ice cream was practically taken over by pb cups. While I do love pb cups, I wanted more of a variety in this ice cream. I only got two pieces of the toffee and less than 5 almonds. The white chocolate was there which was delicious but my favorite is the toffee and unfortunately it was lacking. Overall, it’s good if you’re in the mood for peanut butter cups."
26_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"So I just got this stuff from a local drug store because I’ve never had Ben and Jerry’s before. I was so excited to try it! Once I did, I had to spit it out in the sink. The chocolate, vanilla, and almonds are good, but the toffee covered fudge chunks tasted nothing like hoe they sound. They tasted like blood or rusty metal. Yuck! I thought I could just work my way around the blood tasting fudge pieces, but no, the metallic flavor was everywhere! Not getting this flavor again!"
26_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"I have no idea what it was but randomly through eating it I’d get this terrible taste in my mouth. I came to read other reviews and someone else summed it up perfectly. The toffee tasted like rusty metal! great idea, but something in this is off."
26_bj,3,4.0,2.0,"I debated between this and Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for quite a while but ultimately decided on this because of the Peanut Butter Cups, but there wasnt a single peanut butter cup, if you can believe it!? There was a very generous amount of large Toffee bars, which was nice, but it certainly did fulfill my Peanut butter craving. No hard feelings, just saying!"
26_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"This was my favorite ice cream in the whole world (five stars!) UNTIL the ""new"" toffee. From the other reviews I read, I know your other fans agree with me. And of course this applies to all your other flavors that have Toffee as well, that I USED to enjoy, like Coffee Heath Bar. I appreciate the Non_GMO/Fairtrade efforts, but can you please source Toffee that meets your standards and actually tastes good? The toffee is missing the buttery taste. Or maybe gets Hersheys on board with making some special non GMO Toffee just for you guys? I used to love digging for ""treasure"": the gooey, slightly melted toffee pockets were my favorite part. Now, I dont buy this ice cream nearly as much as I used to, but when I do, I dig around the toffee and throw it away, which is wasteful. I cant just add Heath bars to this myself because they will not get those gooey carmelly toffee pockets."
26_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"This was always my favorite flavor. Lately, though, the Heath Bar pieces and Peanut Butter Cups are few and far between. Like almost non-existent. Just some tiny round balls of chocolate with almonds inside (I think), and flat pieces of chocolate. Are the new owners cheaping out? Please bring back the original - it was one of the best ice creams on the planet!"
26_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My mom bought this flavor my entire childhood and got me hooked on it! Everything in it works seamlessly and provides a different, sweet, chocolaty taste with every bite! The inclusion of the two kinds of ice cream makes it even better!"
26_bj,2,1.0,0.0,This was really good back when this had Heath toffee bars in it. Sadly this is not the case anymore. The new toffee bars are metallic tasting. On top of that all stores within 25 miles of me stopped carrying it. Might be the taste???
26_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Still a fan, but the loss of real Heath bar really downgraded the product. On my bookshelf I have an empty pint of the last container with real Heath bar in it, a happy reminder of a better time in a better product"
26_bj,1,2.0,1.0,Why why why would you guys change my favorite ice cream?! Please go back to the old mix... Im sure people would pay a little more for it if thats the issue...
26_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I decided to try a new flavor, and this sounded appealing. Ugh, I was wrong. Hate the combination. Toffee pieces too big. Ill stick to the ones I know work."
26_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I but 7 pints of this a week and eat every one of them!!! I will drive to every store in my area if I cant find it!!! The best ice cream Ive ever eaten!!!
26_bj,3,2.0,1.0,"Everything but the... stuff I wanted!! Wheres all the yummy stuff? Mostly just ice cream, very few chunks of yummies."
26_bj,1,1.0,0.0,My entire pint only had one piece of toffee. What gives?
27_bj,5,3.0,0.0,The regular chocolate ice cream usually isnt the best but the salty pretzel swirly really elevates it to a new place. The combination creates a salted chocolate flavor that really keeps you coming back for more. Marshmallow swirls are always a good option over mini marshmallows and the almonds add a good crunch. I rounded this up to 5 stars but I would be interested in graham cracker or some type of pastry chunks along with or replacing the almonds. I just simply dont love almonds. Overall 4.5/5 Very good. Worth buying.
27_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"I found this ice cream last year and bought way more than I should have over the summer and cleared out my local Target in the Fall. I mourned the loss of summer and this ice cream until I happened across five pints at that Target close to the holidays! It was a Christmas miracle that I savored well into the new year. Then it was gone...again. I thought that was it until I saw it today back on the shelves. THANK YOU, B&J for bringing this back. I hope this is a permanent summertime flavor!!! The salty/sweet combination is PERFECT!"

27_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"I, myself, am not the biggest fan of ice cream, but I was stocking up for my husband, and I saw this exclusive flavor at Target. Got it home, tried it for myself, and went back the next day to get two more pints! I LOVE IT! The chocolate is so decadent. The marshmallow is scrumptious and the little bits of pretzel give it the perfect dash of crunch and salt. I cannot stop eating it. Dee-lish!"
27_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"I tried this on a whim, and it is now my absolute favorite flavor ever! The combination of chocolate ice cream with slightly salty pretzel bits and globs of gooey marshmallow along with fudge covered almonds is just perfect. Please let this be a regular flavor and not just a limited edition. Pretty, pretty please!"
27_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"BEST FLAVOR EVER. The pretzel swirl is my favorite feature of any ice cream, and the fudge almonds are amazing with the salty pretzel. I was so disappointed when I stopped being able to find it in the store and really hope this flavor makes a comeback! I would make this a staple of my ice cream rotation :)"
27_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Love, Love, Love the Glampfire Trail Mix ice cream! This is the first ice cream that I havent been able to put down and I must have ate it all, cause now I cant find it at any of the Targets. Please, Please, Please make it one of your staple ice creams. It is ridiculously good!! Nice job by the way!!"
27_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I adore all kinds of chocolate ice cream and have a special place in my heart for Ben and Jerry’s (its always just perfectly rich) but this flavor is bar none my favorite ice cream of all time!! It was a seasonal Target only flavor so at the end of the season I bought 9 to last me until next summer!!
27_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Glampfire Trail Mix has chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered almonds, a marsmallow swirl, and a pretzel swirl. The base and almonds provide alot of chocolate flavor that dominates the taste buds when eaten in isolation. The salty pretzel swirl gives a nice crunch and heightens the chocolate, giving it a sort of dark chocolate taste. Its a little overbearing but luckily the sweet marshmallow swirl balances the other components out, providing a great flavor when eaten as a whole. Very close in fact to a rocky road but done better. The only problem is the amount of marshmallow isnt enough. Perhaps I just got a pint with less marshmallow but without more of it, the salty chocolate taste can be overpowering. A great flavor when all the components come together but a little too strong on the chocolate taste otherwise."
27_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Just picked up this pint today, and was blown away by how deliciously rich, textured, and addictive this flavor is. I loved the chocolate covered almonds, the rich chocolate icecream, against the gooey marshmallow, and the nicely salty graham cracker. I am no fan of those cloyingly sweet salted caramels flavors, so I wondered if the salted graham crackers would work. It was perfect! This would be my icecream s’more of choice. Please make this a regular flavor!"
27_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"As an avid ice cream enthusiast I’ve eaten my fair share of ice cream, but this flavor is hands down the greatest I’ve ever had. I stumbled upon it in summer 2018 and then spent an entire year searching for it at every store I went into for the last year. I just found it again and I bought the entire stock. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor! I never write reviews on anything.... but felt compelled to expressed my love for this amazing ice cream!"
27_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"If you like heavenly hash icecream, this is just about the same thing. The marshmallows are very creamy, and the hint of salt from the pretzels accents the chocolate and almonds perfectly. This might be my new favorite flavor! Thanks Ben & Jerry."
27_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Awesome ice cream! The add-ins to this ice cream are just terrific. The marshmallows and pretzels. I cannot stop eating this flavor. I hope you keep it in the rotation!!
27_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"Just bought this this past weekend for the kiddos! My favorite flavor before was Half Baked, but I took a bite of my sons pint of this Glampfire Trail Mix and honestly was MIND BLOWN! The saltiness of the pretzelness mixed with the sweetness of the marshmallow is PERFECT. The perfect texture and you wont be bored because theres always complex, changing flavors throughout! SO DELICIOUS! This is our new FAVORITE"
27_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"This is the most perfect ice cream I have ever eaten. I can’t smell, so I love strong flavors, and this ticks every box. Sweet, salty, creamy, good textures - it’s like ambrosia. When I suspected Target was going to stop carrying it over the winter, I bought 20 pints from my local stores and boy am I glad I did. I’ve had one a week since then, and recently ran out. I PRAY that this comes back next year!!!"
27_bj,1,2.0,0.0,No pretzel swirl in some of them! So disappointing! I feel you owe me my money back for lying to me.
27_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have a lot of favorite ice cream flavors but this is the best one, by far. I am OBSESSED with it, and they stopped stocking it at my local stores as well as the big box stores in my town about a year ago. Im super sad about it, and still scour the shelf every single time, hoping itll come back. The combination of flavors in this one is just perfect, hasnt been matched."
27_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I cannot believe this is not available everywhere!!!! I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan (like I get pints of B&Js instead of cake on my birthday).... this is my absolute favorite flavor! If I had a deep freezer I will just fill it with pints of Glampfire!
27_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor is so close to perfect. Only way it would be better is with more marshmallow and pretzel swirl. So GOOOOOD
28_bj,5,15.0,0.0,"This flavor is amazing. Its everything you didnt even know you wanted all in one. Vanilla AND chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookie dough AND brownies. I cant drop my craving. Plus you get A LOT of the cookie dough and brownie, and I mean A LOT."
28_bj,3,6.0,0.0,I bought me a pint of Ben and jerrys half baked last night at QT reading the description excited to try it mainly because of the brownie chunks but there wasnt any brownie it was mostly just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with hard balls of cookie dough. And I paid 6.99$ bummer
28_bj,4,7.0,0.0,"I really tend to stay away from sweet stuff but once i tried this flavor of ice cream on an impulse buy, ive been hooked since. This has been my go-to snack for 2 years and its constantly stocked in my freezer. Unfortunately over the past couple of months ive noticed a degrade in the brownies. What was once a gooey,chewy delight, is now an odd,kind of crunchy (not in a good way), cake that crumbles in your mouth like a bad cookie. About 3 out of every 4 pints i buy come like this and its grown to be a bugger. I know it may have alot to do with the shipment process, but this was not a problem before and i cant imagine the amount of first time tryers they are shooing away due to this error. This is my favorite ice cream and i hope this issue gets resolved."
28_bj,4,5.0,0.0,"Just sat down to enjoy a pint! I dug right in , and noticed no gobs of anything! Half way through and still.... nothing.. just vanilla and chocolate .. oh wait... 1 piece of brownie.. :(( The vanilla and chocolate was as good as ever! But misssing the gobs of goodness !! I am thinking... maybe I got the special pint??? :)) I am a regular..sometimes daily! Pint eater.. so it wont slow me down.. I am guessing, better luck next time!? Hope so! Here is the upc # 76840 10132 just in case inquiring minds would like to know!? Bottom of container # is 84141103 maybe that will help get to the bottom of "" the missing gobs"" BTW... my favorite of all time was the penut Carmel cluster that was out, I believe Last summer! Any chance of it making its was back on the shelf?"
28_bj,1,6.0,5.0,"Over the last month, I’ve purchased 4 or 5 pints of this flavor, and ever single time, the cookie dough has been hard and slightly chalky, and the brownies have been dry, shapeless, and just... gross. Before they were distinct cubes of chewy, rich goodness! What happened? Is it a specific distribution center or something or did they change the formula somehow? This is my favorite flavor of Ben n Jerry’s, and honestly my favorite flavor of ice cream in general. But not the last month... Consistently disappointing is how I would sum up my experience."
28_bj,5,4.0,0.0,One of my favorite Ben & Jerry’s pints! I can’t not eat the entire container. The ice creams are excellent in flavor and texture and the brownie and cookie dough chunks are sublime. I actually eat this with one of my toddler’s little spoons so it lasts longer. Please never kill this flavor!
28_bj,1,5.0,3.0,"I have been buying a pint of half baked every week for at least the last 6 years. However for the last EIGHT MONTHS every pint has been a disappointment-either almost no cookie dough/brownies or when they are present they are dry, chalky, crumbly-not the gooey moist texture I had fallen in love with. Have tried from multiple stores even in different states with same results. So sad they changed formulation or something I used to look forward to this every week :( Hope they fix production issues soon"
28_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I wanted a treat this evening but I had no idea what I was getting into with Half Baked. So good it is dangerous. The remains of the pint are deep in my freezer now but I feel the urge to set it free. Great balance of vanilla and a superb chocolate ice cream and generous bites of brownie. The perfect way to eat brownie, too - saturated with creamy rich ice cream. And THEN there is cookie dough, too! It ALL tastes good, together and individually."
28_bj,1,11.0,10.0,"I used to love this flavor and have been enjoying it for years. Unfortunately I had to stop buying it because every pint I have purchased over the past year has contained dry, chalky cookie dough - not the buttery, creamy dough that I grew to love. This flavor used to be so decadent. I sent a letter last year to let them know, but nothing changed after their response. I am pretty bummed that this is still an issue."
28_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I mean look its simple every one loves gooie cookies An gooie brownies even the batter , An yes Ive tried your brownie batter core ice cream but Ill save that for another time, because half baked deserves nothing but 5 stars An an a min for some gloating of its own lol you guys are awesome keep doing what you do , p.s your impact is far beyond ice cream, it touches homes An hearts everywhere<3"
28_bj,2,2.0,0.0,i would regularly purchase Half baked ahead of other pints. it is a close tie for favorite. However the past 2 months ive noticed the cookie dough seems flavorless and powdery while the brownies that once had a glorious chew feel more like cookies. its a shame this has happened i think this flavors headed for the grave.
28_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"Half baked has always been my favorite Ben & Jerrys. After not having it for a year, I saw it at my local store and bought 2 pints! Then to my disappointment, I found both the brownie and cookie dough to be dry. Usually the chewy fudge brownie is the best part! Not a crumbling dry mess. I hope this was just a bad batch..."
28_bj,1,3.0,1.0,"I bought a pint of half baked after years of it being absent in my life. I expected a cookie and brownie bonanza, but my ice cream had NO COOKIE DOUGH and only TWO BROWNIE CHUNKS. I am severely disappointed and dont think Ill ever get it again. Shame because this used to be my favorite flavor."
28_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"Like other have mentioned, the quality of this particular flavor definitely seems to have gone down hill. Use to be my go to flavor but now I find myself avoiding it more often than not."
28_bj,1,4.0,2.0,"this is the third time I have gotten this flavor and the brownies and cookie dough were dry and really hard and crusty! inconsistent with this flavor becuase some pints its ok and really good, but its not consistant with quality"
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Been eating Half Baked for years!!!!! I absolutely love it. Buy a pint every week. Since moving to Texas from Pennsylvania in 2017, I noticed the cookie dough changed and became chalky. Not sure why in Texas it changed. Its become luck of the draw, sometimes its good and sometimes I get a bad batch. Lately its gotten better. Praying it stays that way."
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I hope this never gets cut, because this flavor is so yummy! Its definitely a basic flavor, but its incredibly well-executed. The base ice creams are rich and delicious, and the mix-ins are HUGE! The brownies are rich with gooey, and the cookie dough pieces are spot on. Must buy!"
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Half baked has always been my go to flavor. Although I have ventured out and found other flavors I love, Half Baked is always the one I eventually go back to. I can’t get enough of the wonderful chunks of brownies and cookie dough! Yum yum yum!!!"
28_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I love the taste of the ice creme mixed with brownie and cookie dough, and this is the perfect mix!! Unfortunately, the brownie and especially the cookie dough was extremely dry and crumbly.. hoping I just had a weird batch."
28_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Huge fan. Only flavor ice cream I eat. Unfortunately, noticing ""the gobs"" arent quite there like they used to be. I might switch to the chocolate fudge brownie quart"
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I would give it 6 stars if I could, thank you, Ben and Jerrys, you are a blessing in my life. I dont know how I could survive school without half-baked."

28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Love this ice cream! Seriously have 2-3 pints in my fridge at any given time! YUM!!
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,One of the best flavors that exists!!! Totally recommended!
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is my all time favorite flavor! I love it so much!!!
28_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So f*cking good plz bless yourself and buy it plzz
29_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"And dont buy them ever again. Its a waste of your money. Because Ben and Jerry have finally made the best cookies n cream and brought it too the masses. Instead of vanilla icecream with a cookie crumb every now and then, its jam packed with cookies. Its everything cookies n cream fans have always wanted. I bought this at my local Walmart last week and was blown away. Finished the pint in 2 days. I went back to the store multiple times, couldnt find it. Ive called many other Walmarts. They were all out too. Grab this one while you can! Get two or three even!"
29_bj,5,20.0,0.0,"Ben & Jerrys has reinvented my favorite basic ice cream flavor, Cookies and Cream. This should just replace all Cookies and Cream flavors everywhere and be the new standard for what is Cookies and Cream. Finally, someone actually put enough cookies in the ice cream. Usually, Cookies and Cream tastes like vanilla ice cream with the ocasional taste of cookie. This seems to be the other way around and I love it. Big cookie pieces! I hope this flavor never goes away."
29_bj,5,11.0,2.0,"Attn:: So my 6 year old saw this flavor and asked me to buy it, i did. He eats the carton within 2 days saying it was the best he ever tasted, super rare for him to devour ice cream that fast.. Beggs for another carton, I carry on and I go buy another carton for him. Later on my hubby is making a cup for my son and he randomly tasted it. Came to me like babe thats the best cookie and cream ice cream i ever had, ranting and raving... So me going to being nosey in the middle of the night i secures a cup. WHOOOOAAAAA! Blown away with its deliciousness. Needless to say i have to go to the store tomorrow to replace my sons carton LOL. We are all addicted. BNJ PUHHHHLEEEEASEEEE DO NOT GET RID OF THIS FLAVOR! I see those limited edition wrappings! Please dont do it. LOL. Sincerely The Late Night Snackin Mom"
29_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I picked this up with the Red, White and blueberry shortbread and the The Sweet like sugar new flavor as well a few days ago. And have to say that I was not disappointed at all. I know this is more of a tamer flavor for the company. But I cant help but feel that is what makes this flavor the best. Because there are so many cookies and cream variations out there, that dont always taste the best. And this one definitely does not disappoint with this shopper. Keep it up."
29_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"So another brand use to have Ice Cream Sandwich ice cream but they stopped selling it and all this year I have been searching. Alas, here comes B&J to save the day. I absolutely love and have bought like 3 -4 cartons of it since its come out. Cookies and Cream but amplified!! If you guys bring out Superman ice cream I know that B&J pays attention to their customer base!!"
29_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I ate an entire pint in one day and now I can’t find it anywhere!! It’s soo good!
29_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I have been waiting for YEARS for Ben and Jerrys to come out with this flavor! Its so amazing! Just letting you know, if you get rid of this flavor after completing said life, I will never buy your ice cream again! Lol"
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I can’t even begin to describe to you how good this is. Forget about all other cookies and cream ice creams. You don’t need other ones anymore. THIS is everything cookies and cream should be. It’s so riddled with cookie crumbs and big cookie chunks it’s a cookie dream come true. You won’t be disappointed with this one! Excellent job Ben & Jerry’s! Never stop making this!
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I picked this up last week at Walmart and I’m glad I did. The best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had. For some reason I wasn’t expecting as good as it was and it blew me away. Hopefully this one never goes away! Definitely pick it up if you’re at a Wal-Mart
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My husband and I could eat this by the gallon if it were available. We can’t even share a pint and always have to buy one each. I can only hope that this flavor becomes widespread and never leaves the line up! We are addicted! :)
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Bought this yesterday and I was not disappointed. As an avid Cookies & Cream eater, this looked enticing, but it was SOOO much better than expected. PLEASE do not get rid of this one ever!!!"
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I brought ice cream Sammie today and let me tell you it’s so good I love it great Job Ben n jerry it is my new favorite definely recommend.
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Saw a new product and it was somewhat similar to sweet cream and cookies which i needed to try. It was amazing!!!!!!
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I cant get enough of this ice cream I buy one every time I got to the store and the name has a bit of meaning to me
29_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Way to go Ben & Jerry’s!! This is the best cookies & cream ice cream!!! Please make it a regular flavor!!
29_bj,5,2.0,1.0,Best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had. I hope they make a non-dairy version
30_bj,5,105.0,0.0,"Ive been buying Milk & Cookies for i dont even know how long. I have to drive 30 minutes total just to go get it because none of my local stores have it. Its officially ruined all other cookies & cream flavored ice creams for me, nothing can top it. I mean, itt got TWO kinds of cookies in it. What??? Man thats a lot of cookie. And you know, every time I buy a pint, I always think ""man, is this $4-something-or-other worth it for just one pint?"" and every time I get a different brands cookies and cream flavor I always get my answer. Its absolutely worth it. This will be served at my wedding, and most certainly at my funeral. If anyone comes up to me and tries to convince me theres a better flavor out there, they can expect nothing less than a full on war."
30_bj,5,10.0,1.0,"I recently came across the Milk&Cookies flavor at my local convenient store and...WOW! If Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Tates, Milano, and Nutella came together to make the best flavor of ice cream ever, it would not even come close to Milk&Cookies. The only problem is that I am becoming addicted and it is starting to affect my social life. Although my girlfriend dumped me and my friends no longer want to spend time with me, I will never stop eating Milk&Cookies Ice Cream. I am willing to take out a mortgage in order to purchase Milk&Cookie Ice Cream in larger quantities. Thank you Ben. Thank you Jerry."
30_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"This is just what I was hoping for tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s chocolatey, caramely, marshmallowy gooie flavors the most but tonight I wanted something different. I wanted exactly what Milk and Cookies delivered; a delicious vanilla ice cream with cookie swirls. No fudge chunks or nuts or oozey mix ins this time (even though that’s my favorite). Just a perfect ‘dry’ blend of cookie swirls and excellent vanilla ice cream. I will get this one every time I need a break from the Phish Food, Karamel Sutra and peanut butter fudge cores of the world. Awesome flavor!"
30_bj,4,9.0,0.0,"I was going to give it 5-stars, because its BY FAR the best ice cream flavor that Ive ever tasted! However, Milk & Cookies isnt available in a lot of stores, so its definitely a challenge to find sometimes. Our local Whole Foods is really the only place that carries it. But, if you can find it, TRY IT! You wont be disappointed!"
30_bj,5,12.0,1.0,"Ive been buying Ben & Jerrys for ages now, but Ive never really been consistent with a certain flavor. Ive always kept buying new ones to try. Im on vacation in Florida, and found the Milk & Cookies one in the local grocery store and HAD to try it. Needless to say, we went back and grabbed 3 more the next day!"
30_bj,5,8.0,0.0,I tried this flavor once because they were out of my past fav- Cookie Dough. This one is a million times better! The cookies are amazing. The ice cream is amazing. Everything together is awesome. Thank you Ben and Jerrys for an awesome flavor. I could eat 20 pints of this.
30_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I am the lady who will buy up the whole store if I see cookies & milk B&J ice cream on the shelf. I ate 2 pints in one day once! It all started, they were out of cookie dough (my old favorite) so decided to try the next best cookie thing on the shelf. Boy was I GLAD I did. It became my new favorite INSTANTLY. It’s so good though I have to really warm folks that you may NEVER want another flavor again. That’s what’s happened to me going on 3 years now since discovering it. My only problem with it is I’m mad I didn’t find out about it sooner!! I LOVE EVERY BUT ABOUT! 100 thumbs up!!! MMMMMM"
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,LOVE THIS ICE CREAM! Its the perfect combination.!! Thank you Ben & Jerrys
30_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Every time I get ice cream this is the flavor I reach for, some people think its a boring flavor but that is in no way accurate. It combines my favorite flavors, cookie dough and cookies & cream creating the ultimate ice cream. With no overpowering crazy flavors, it took classic flavors and made them better. Ice cream will truly never taste the same - big shoutout to both Ben and Jerry for this one. (also its a great post-run dessert)"
30_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I had always been strictly Half Baked or Americone Dream, until I tried Milk & Cookies when all others were sold out. Needless to say I found a new reigning favorite. Nothing can compare to the gooey-ness of the cookie swirls - NOTHING. I fell very strongly about this ice cream flavor and I will defend its title as the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor."
30_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I’m not the type of person to sit and eat a bowl of ice cream but with this flavor I can eat a whole pint, it the best ice cream flavor I have ever had, my boyfriend and I have to drive 30 min away just to buy it because no local stores carry it.. My boyfriend is an ice cream lover and he even says this is the best ice cream ever."
30_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I ordered an unspecified pint of Ben & Jerrys from the deli and my delivery guy gave me this gem. I fell in love. It was fate <3
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My husband and I have a pint B&Js probably every 3 days. This one is such a hit! We love Half Baked but this one is like a soft cookie sundae. My favorite is getting those little chocolate chips in the mix, it just adds another layer of something already fantastic. It would be dope if there were full sized mini chocolate chips instead of the micro ones. Either way, great flippin ice cream!"
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have a deep and intense love for this ice cream. If I could marry it, I would. B&Js best ice cream flavor by a long shot, and they never skimp on the fix ins. All my friends write it off as just a regular cookies and cream ice cream but NO! This is so much more than that. I would like to be buried in a coffin shaped like a B&Js pint of Milk & Cookies ice cream. That is all."
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I found myself wanting ice cream one day and I found this flavor in one of my local stores. I thought it would be strange with 2 different cookies , boy was I wrong ! Definetly one of my favorites of not my top favorite. Besides whos not in the mood for milk and cookies !?! Youd just be crazy if you said you werent. HIGHLY suggest this flavor you will not regret it !"
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I have been getting milk & cookies for years now and when I run out, I HAVE to restock. I don’t normally even have a sweet tooth, but there’s just something about the texture and taste of the cookies mixed with this ice cream! Milk & Cookies is my all time favorite ice cream and I always make my friends try it. You should too!"
30_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"This is literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever had! Im actually eating it as I write this review. I just have one suggestion for the recipe...ADD MORE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!! This is a 10/10 ice cream flavor, but it would be a 20/10 if there were more chocolate chip cookie chunks in it!"
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite flavor. I get it anytime I am able! I love the swirls of cookie and the huge chunks of cookie that you get mixed in. I dont like cookie dough in ice-cream, so this works superbly. I love that it includes both chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookies."
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite flavor changes every year or so. Milk & Cookies is this years. Whats the point of buying boring cookie dough flavor when this is available? The cookie swirl works so well and is such a great addition to the TWO kinds of cookie dough in this delicious blend.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I have not bought another ice cream in years. This is the best ice cream available in a pint that I have ever had. I have not even gotten sick of this ice cream. The two types of cookies (especially the light one) is absolutely delicious!
30_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I bought this for the first time the other day and boy was I in for it. I used to get the fudge brownie but they were always skimpin on the brownie bits. And now here I am, writing a review about ice cream!!!!!"
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Milk & Cookies is in my top five of favorites from Ben & Jerry’s. The marrying of high quality vanilla ice cream and three types of cookies is a delectable treat sure to satisfy anyone’s sweet tooth.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Milk & Cookies is the best ice cream flavor you will ever buy. I could eat pints and pints of this. You HAVE to try it! HIGHLY recommend!!!

30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is one of my favorite bnj flavors. I would describe it as a mix of cookie dough and cookies and cream.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I once drove almost two hours for a pint of milk and cookies because the grocery store was out of it. Enough said.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is one my wife just cannot pass up! Thank you Ben & Jerry for this wonderful get out of jail free card.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,BEST ice cream in the universe. Never buying anything else.
30_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I’m a happy huge cookie fan so this ice cream is amazing!
31_bj,5,5.0,0.0,This is my favorite Icecream in the whole wide world. POINT BLANK PERIOD. I drive 5 miles to the closest store that carries it atleast 1 a week which is a good thing as if it were closer is probably eat it everyday. Amazing job on this one guys!
31_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Its been a while since Ive bought this ice cream because I cant find it in my local grocery store but I love this flavor so much! I ate two pints in one sitting! My doctor says I need to stop buying Ben and Jerrys because of my diabetes but I cant stop! Aaahhh! I love this ice cream so much that I have to sneak it in the house because my family tries to hide it from me. Ive stopped eating regular food and I basically just eat ice cream every meal. This has to be one of my favorite flavors after half baked! Thank you for your service, Ben and Jerry!"
31_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"Literally my favorite ice cream out of all of the ice cream Ive eaten in the world. Sometimes its hard to find at certain stores, but Ill climb through a freezer door to search for it. #NoShame"
31_bj,5,6.0,0.0,This is my go to flavor whenever I buy Ben & Jerrys! I love how big the chocolate cookie chunks are!
31_bj,1,8.0,2.0,This has always been my favorite but the last 3 pints I have bought have had almost no chocolate cookie chunks! This is very upsetting as this is my favorite ice cream and my favorite park is the cookie chunks. I instead have been left with mint ice cream with a few spattering of what looks like cookie crumbs. For the high price of B&Js I expected more.
31_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"I really like this flavor, it is super awesome! For real, my favorite."
31_bj,5,6.0,1.0,"I like big chunks of cookie & I cannot lie. Unlike the cookie dust thats typical of most cookies & cream, my pint had about three quarter cookie sized pieces & many more respectable sized chunks besides. & of course chocolate & mint play nice together."
31_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Me and this flavor have been going strong for 10+ years in fact it’s been my “gateway” flavor which lured me into supporting this company and branching out to find new flavors I love (such as justice remix, oatmeal cookie etc..) it’s super refreshing with thick Oreo pieces and doesn’t have that weird green color other companies add"
31_bj,1,6.0,5.0,"As a chunk fan who loves half baked, I recently decided to stop loyally buying my pints of Half Baked and gave this flavor a try. I read it was supposed to have big, generous sized cookie pieces all throughout the pint. Well, my pint didnt have a single big cookie chunk! It was just very small crumbles and mainly mint ice cream. Im so disappointed! I was expecting this to be the ultimate ice cream for chunk lovers based on what I heard. :("
31_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I dont write reviews, or didnt prior to today...I love this ice cream so much, it encompasses everything about a mint and chocolate cookie combination that makes me dream about eating more and more and more. I would live inside my pint if I could, build a little mint ice cream igloo with a cookie door, eat my way out and rebuild"
31_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I check for this flavor every single time Im in an ice cream isle, even if Im not buying ice cream that day. I *scout* for it, all over the US. And I almost NEVER find it. I found the first pint in the last five years and its still the best ice cream pint there is. Fresh but decadent but light but chomky. The fricken best."
31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I like big chunks and I cannot lie! You other B&J fans cant deny! Well, most of you- my friend prefers sorbet. Anyway, ever since Mint Oreos have been put on the shelves, theyve been my favorite flavor! So when I saw this at my grocery store, I did a happy dance in the frozen aisle. The peppermint is to die for, and the chocolate sandwich cookies are like oreos! You did it again, B&J."
31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My wife and I are both mint chocolate ice cream fans so when we found this one at the store, we had to try it. First off, the mint ice cream: rich, creamy, minty and delicious. And the mint tastes natural. Sometimes other brand’s mint tastes so artificial. Next, not satisfied with chips, this ice cream gives you whole cream-filled cookies! Awesome awesome stuff."
31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,as a mint lover i can truthfully say that this is one of the best! my mom buys this one for me all the time though there are usually very little left in store. i highly recommend this one! much better than minter wonderland which is an abomination to this planet(see my review):) i would add an image of a happy gamer but the stock images are invalid lol
31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I dont enjoy chocolate chunks/chips in cold foods, but I like mint ice cream so much that I have bought mint chocolate chip ice cream, grudgingly eating around cocoa clusters. Thanks to Ben & Jerrys, there are no longer any obstacles to my enjoymint! Cookies are texturally lovely in this minty pint."
31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Look. Ben, Jerry, Ben & Jerry, whatever you two go by, this ice cream is too good. You’ve got me hooked like I’ve never been hooked on ice cream before, and I can’t see any end in sight. How did it happen? I don’t know, but what I do know is I can’t complain."
31_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"Its good overall, I wish they had a plain cookies and creme or a Mint Chocolate Chip. Similar to a thin-mint from the Girl Scouts. Not a favorite with me."

31_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My first pint of MCC (“Mint Chocolate Cookie”) changed my outlook on life and I haven’t looked back since. Strongly recommend.

32_bj,5,13.0,1.0,"Rich and decedent, this is a great flavor if you like mint and dark chocolate. Just looking at that glassy smooth ice cream just after taking the lid off makes my mouth water. It’s not as minty as Mint Chocolate Cookie, which is fine, and the dark chocolate ice cream is so decedent! The marshmallow is a perfect addition and the cookie is great. I’m glad I found this new flavor. Yum yum!"
32_bj,5,8.0,1.0,"I was so sad when Gimme Smores season was over but when I saw Minter Wonderland staring at me through the freezer case door, I knew it was meant to be. Its decadantly creamy and perfectly chocolately. Not too rich or bitter like a lot of other dark chocolates; plus the gooeyness of the marshamallows balances with the crunchiness of the cookies. One of my favorite flavors EVER."
32_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"I have contemplated this review for quite some time. Unfortunately, it is officially time to let you all know about the greatest ice cream EVER MADE! I am flabbergasted that more people have never heard of this ingenious creation. It is by far the most perfected ice cream, which contains the best combination of flavors and ingredients to hit this planet. I am saddened to know that this review will for sure be read by millions and in turn lower my chances of being the only one at my local target eating this ice cream. I have withheld this important message for this long due to my own need to always have a fully stocked freezer of this amazing product. All i ask is that if you are contemplating buying more than 15 of these pints at once, just leave enough for myself to stock my personal Minter Wonderland freezer at home. Now to get to the real reason for this review. I am hoping that one of the millions that read this review may work for Ben and Jerrys or Target and start the long needed process to make this ice cream available ALL year and in ALL locations. Thank you and please do not touch MY Minter Wonderland pint."

33_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"I love this flavour most of all ice cream brands and/or flavours out there. I used to buy it whenever I landed at the airport (back to school) after Christmas vacation up North in Norway, back in the day when it still was sold here. Now they have discontinued this flavour for some unknown reason (it cant be due to consumer preferance- Im sure!!!) and allthough there are a lot of good ice cream out there, it is just not the same without the super chunky rich chocolate flavour of B&Js New York Super fudge chunk. Can someone please tell my disinformed country to BRING IT BACK??! Thank you. Cincerely yours (having withdrawal symptoms as we speak)"

WalMart - South Charleston, WV and Kroger, Danville, WV are two locations in between where we live. The WalMart gets a lot of traffic and I know it would sell well there. PLEASE help a sister out. I have lost 100 lbs in the last few years and this is my treat to myself but I can never find it anywhere.

33_bj,5,8.0,1.0,"Been a fan since its debut! The very best chocolate ice cream as the base, with tons of chocolate chunks and nuts to keep it exciting. We come back to this flavor every time and have never been disappointed"
33_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is without a doubt my all time favourite ice cream. I used to love phish food but then I discovered New York super fudge chunk and have never looked back. Not just my favourite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream but my favourite ice cream. The chocolate is divine and all the different chunks are really what makes it so special. It’s just a shame that it’s so hard to come by at times and I am terrified that one day it might get discontinued. I might just have to buy in bulk now and save up just in case!
33_bj,5,3.0,0.0,In my opinion this is the best flavor by far. It is so fun to find a chocolate covered nut and chocolate chips. I am not a white chocolate fan but this ice cream is super chocolatey and the while chocolate really complements it. It is super chocolate! And it is so hard to find in stores it is always sold out. Maybe it should move up in the ranks of the favorite flavors.

33_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I’ve bought this several times going to see a movie, the textures and complex profiles of buttery-rich savory flavors leaves a satisfying experience for someone who doesn’t typically indulge in sweets and desserts. The level of variety of textures in this is really an enjoyable experience unlike other ice creams that try to work in nuts or chunks of chewables that really feel like a hindrance to the chewing aspect, but not this. No. This is done right and there is nothing more that could be improved upon. Love this!"

I may even get some this weekend just because. :-)"

33_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Let me start by saying you have caused this Texan to defect from Blue Bell long before the Issue they had a few years back.

33_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is my very favorite ice cream of all time! Sometimes stores don’t sell it- so when I see it in a store I get so happy! Chocolate icecream with chocolate chunks! It is so so good!!! It’s kinda good they don’t sell it at every store because I would eat way too much of this delicious stuff!!
33_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I usually don’t love nuts in ice cream but this one is different! The Ben and Jerry’s chocolate ice cream (the best chocolate ice cream on the market) and the fudge chunks are perfect and the nuts are nice. Really great pint all in all.
33_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I loveee chocolate ice cream and Ben and Jerry’s already gets that right. Then they add the SUPER FUDGE chunks. Yes!! Walnuts , white and dark chocolate pieces. My fav ever. A pint doesn’t last us long, ever."

34_bj,5,24.0,1.0,"When Oatmeal Cookie Chunk stopped being made, I was DEVASTATED! It was the only Ben & Jerrys icecream that I bought regularly. So for years Ive been really disappointed. Today while at the store I saw it and jumped for joy! I have to say this flavor is very similar to the old, except the oatmeal cookie part is more crunchy this time around. Im still super pleased and hope its here to stay!!"
34_bj,2,20.0,8.0,"Like everyone else, I was excited to try this so called new flavor because the flavor description reminded me of my favorite flavor, the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk that randomly disappeared years ago..... Sadly this flavor is not as great. Ive had it twice now and both times I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. The only thing that was right about this was the brown sugar base does taste like the cinnamon base from the original flavor. Anyway, I digress... Itll have to do since its the closest theyve gotten to resurrecting the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk. Just please less fudge flakes or you guys might as well change the name...."
34_bj,1,4.0,1.0,"Everything about this is great - the oatmeal cookie hunks, the cinnamon butter sugar brown Im getting tongue tied just thinking about it - but I loathe chocolate. I feel like a good oatmeal cookie doesnt have chocolate in it - reserve that for the chocolate chip fans out there. But I tried this anyway, figuring the chocolate might be limited enough I could just grimace and get through it, but nope :( The chocolate was more apparent than the oatmeal cookie itself. This one was just an extra stab in the heart because I was holding out hope that the chocolate chunks were less common than they are in the Cherry Garcia."
34_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"Alli can say is heaven lol. My all time favorite has alwaya been chunkey monkey mostly because of the delicious chunks of chocolate in the ice cream now i found another favorite which is this oat of this swirled. Im sorry to say but the other reviewers who are complaining are picky and can not compare or expect this to be the same as other past sinilar flavors. All in all the chocolate chunks with a cinnamon taste which fully satisfies my cravings. I have one problem though, once i start i can’t stop lol. Overall ben and jerry’s always comes through the right way.! Love ben and jerry’s! No im not sponsered (but i wish i was) ha!"
34_bj,3,15.0,0.0,"Im not sure this is ""new"" its reminiscent of a flavor I had a handful of years ago at a B&Js shop in Vegas. But in my opinion there could be a lot more cinnamon cookie swirls and a little less chocolate fudge flakes. Ive had 2 pints now with not much on the cookie chunk front."
34_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The original oatmeal cookie ice cream was my all time favorite and I was saddened for years when it was taken off the shelfs. Imagine my surprise when I saw a new oatmeal flavor was introduced. I quickly purchased it and enjoyed it, but did notice there were not very many cookies chunks. Unfortunately ever since, I have not been able to find this flavor anywhere! All of my local retailers have plenty of urban burban and truffle kerfuffle - but no oat of this swirled anywhere in sight! I am having nightmares of this flavor being taken away again! And only after such a brief time! Say it aint so Ben and Jerry!"
34_bj,4,3.0,0.0,"I was SO excited when they brought this flavor back to the shelves. I missed the Oatmeal Cookie Chuck (my absolutely all time favorite flavor) oh so much. But the excitement soon was lost when I realized it was not the same OCC I loved so much. There was no chunks of cookies in the ice cream, and I know its supposed to be a swirl, but 1) it would actually be out of this world if there were the original OCC chunks in it and 2) there was hardly any oatmeal cookie swirl in it. Ive bought it a few more times hoping that the production has gotten better with adding more of the oatmeal cookie, but nothing has changed. Very sad. I just wish they could add in the cookie chunks in it like they do for milk and cookies (but oatmeal of course). :("
34_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"This is the flavour my roommate always used to buy in college and it was through her that I tried it for the first time. Not gonna lie, its good enough that I (shamefully, and maybe a little drunkenly) was compelled to steal a small spoonful after a late night out. The brown sugar base is just so rich, that when paired with the oat cookies, you just feel all warm and cozy. Like grandma just visited, minus the raisins. It has chocolate flakes though, which have just enough bitterness to them that youre not overwhelmed by the buttery base. Safe to say after my dip into thievery had passed (and I had a 12 hour nap) I went and got my own pint. Sorry girlie! It only happened once I swear."

34_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"I really like this flavor idea. I love any ice cream flavor of ""oatmeal cookie"". Honestly the huge chunks of fudge makes me gag . I end up picking them out after 2.... I was expecting a lot more oatmeal cookie. I think it would really be ""Oat of this swirled"" if you added just a bit more oatmeal cookie, took about a 1/4 of the fudge chucks and shaved them instead. That sounds perfect to me. Please alert me when these changes have been implemented. Thanks so much❣"
34_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I wanted to love this. And.... I like it, but didnt love. Oatmeal Cookie was my all time favorite ice cream before it was pulled, and so I immediately purchased this when I saw this in the store. But, the cookie definitely did not have any of the amazing chunks I was expecting, and to further disappoint, barely had any traces/flavoring swirled in at all. The base was good (and maybe even an improvement on the Oatmeal Cookie!), but it really did not make up for the lack of cookie. Oh Ben and Jerrys, why do you tease me so?!"
34_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I first came across this flavor in November 2018 and I was instantly hooked. Unfortunately, I havent been able to find in anywhere since and Ive traveled across the country, from Washington state to Virginia for the holidays. Not a single pint to be found. Im desperate!"
34_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"Oatmeal cookie chunk was my all time favorite ice cream, so when I saw oat of this swirled being released I was super excited! Unfortunately it doesnt quite stack up. The flavor is really good but I was disappointed to see that it was just a swirl of cookie (if you can call it that, my pint barely had any) and not more substantial chunks. I miss being able to taste chunks of delicious oatmeal cookies in my ice cream."
34_bj,5,2.0,0.0,A nearly perfect pint. There were TONS of fudge chips in this one and the cookie swirl was dense and super yummy. The ice cream didn’t scream ‘buttery brown sugar’ though. It’s really good tasting ice cream and you do get a hint of those flavors but it could have been coming off the cookie swirl as easily. But that’s a small issue and it really is a great tasting pint which I will definitely buy again!
34_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"Im eating this right now for the first time, and its absolutely amazing! It does remind me of the former Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, which was my favorite flavor, but I actually like this one even better. The combination of sweet cinnamon ice cream, delicious oatmeal cookies, and fantastic fudge flakes truly is out of this world! Oat of This Swirled is my absolute new favorite! THANK YOU for bringing back an ice cream with oats! Its phenomenal!!!"
34_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Literally my favorite flavor ever. I scarfed down a pint of this in one sitting. And I did that multiple times. So sad I’m not seeing it in grocery stores anymore though :(
34_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"Oatmeal Cookie Chunk was my all time favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream. Although the flavor of this ""replacement"" is very good, it lacks a much desired cookie dough texture. The ""oatmeal cinnamon cookie swirl"" does not offer a different texture to the regular ice cream. I was pretty bummed, but it does have good flavor... just lacks any cookie texture."
34_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"When the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk disappeared without warning it was a sad day for this devoted ice cream lover :( Oh my goodness, although slightly different, it is a delicious reincarnation of my old favorite!! Please dont get rid of this one too Ben and Jerrys :)"
34_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This ice cream was an instant NEW favorite of mine! It is nearly as good as its apparent predecessor, the dearly departed Oatmeal Cookie Chunk! Way to go Ben & Jerry!"
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love this flavor so much! The base has a lot of tasty cinnamon and I agree with other reviewers that there are a ton of chocolate fudge flakes but I actually like them because they seem to be darker chocolate and they balance all the sweetness and richness of the buttery ice cream and cookie swirl. I also love the texture of the swirl--its a little gritty (in a good way) and super sweet. All around amazing flavor!
34_bj,4,3.0,1.0,"I was also a fan of Oatmeal Cookie Chunk but I also agree that this is just slightly better bc of the cinnamon crunch. But there should be cookie dough-like chunks, similar to Cinnamon Buns or Cookie Dough and this would be over the top amazing!"
34_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Super underrated flavor. Will forever be one of my favorites. Perfect balance
34_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I decided to try something new--so glad I did! Might be a new favorite.
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I just recently cane across this flavor. It did remind me of the punt that had chunks of oatmeal cookie, which was the best cream ever, then it was no longer in stores which sucks. This flavor is good, I just wish there was more of the swirl in it. I love the big chocolate chips. Please do not discontinue this flavor it please bring back the oatmeal chunk flair."
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Typically when I buy ice cream, I want chocolate. I typically go for Phish Food, or the older Smores flavor, or even the chocolate brownie. I was SO shocked to find that I LOVE this flavor! The brown sugar and oatmeal are just amazing and the chocolate flakes give it enough chocolatey flavor. This is now one of my new favorites and in the top 4 of B&J choices."
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the best B&J flavor going. If you’ve ever had the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor that no longer exists, you’re in luck. The base of Oat Of This Swirled is very similar. It’s just one of those things where the flavors and textures all come together perfectly in every bite. It’s a scoop of heaven (ok, make mine two scoops)!"
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I am a huge ice cream fan and especially love very intense flavors. I found Oat of This Swirled about a month ago and WOW. This is honestly the greatest ice cream flavor ever.

34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I have probably eaten at least 11 pints of this! It tastes exactly like an oatmeal cookie with just the right amount of chocolate! It is definitely a comfort treat and the best flavor Ben & Jerrys makes! I hope it stays forever!
34_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I literally ate this stuff for dinner. Its absolutely amazing and so satisfying. I was glad there were pieces of dark chocolate rather than fudge swirls. That made it so much better.

35_bj,5,8.0,0.0,"Now you have to be in a peanut butter mood to have this ice cream, but when you are, its the best. Im impressed. It would be easy to make the rookie mistake of going for the cream when youre only feeling somewhat ~nutty~ but this is a flavor that makes you commit. So before you purchase, ask yourself, am I feeling nuts enough for this today? If the answer is yes, then taking home a pint of this ice cream will probably be the best decision you make all day. This is not necessarily my favorite flavor, but it is a fantastic one."
35_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"What can I say about this one? It’s a simple concoction: peanut butter ice cream loaded with little peanut butter cups, and it is SUBLIME! As per usual, the ice cream flavor and texture are perfect and the pb cups are also. It’s also very dense and heavy so you feel good n’ full after you polish off a full pint (if you manage it). This is one amazing pint that always makes me feel better. I could eat this every night!"
35_bj,5,5.0,1.0,I love peanut butter ice cream an d an never find it. Peanut butter cups are also my favorite candy. This combination is the absolute best. I hope you consider changing your pint slice to the peanut butter ice cream instead of the vanilla.
35_bj,5,6.0,1.0,Addict since the first time i tasted. WAY TOO PERFECT!!!
35_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"If you love peanut butter, this is the one for you!! Sometimes theres not enough peanut butter cups, but the peanut butter ice cream is good all on its own."
35_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"This is as good as it gets. My absolute favorite B&J flavor, as well as probably my favorite flavor of icecream. It broke my heart when they stopped producing it in my country."
35_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I am addicted to this ice cream. The only negative thing I can come up with is when there are too many butter cup chunks are in the same pot. They are just too hard and too sweet to be eaten without a sufficient amount of that smooth and mild peanut ice cream.
35_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"After trying the magnum peanut butter flavour last week, I had to try this and its just as good! Smmoth peanut butter gives texture to the ice cream (and you can still taste the cream!) and the chunky chocolate gives the contrast."
35_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Really even if you are not a fan this ice cream will blow your mind !!!!!
35_bj,5,2.0,1.0,I have eaten this many many times... It is literally perfection.
36_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"This ice cream actually had me spend a whole Sunday afternoon going to 3 different Targets to purchase it! I finally found some at the 3rd Target but was fully prepared to go to a 4th if necessary. THAT is how good this ice cream is!! The chocolate is rich, the peanut butter is perfectly blended in but then you get COOKIES TOO?? It just makes your mouth happy! I was addicted from the first spoonful and buy it in 3s whenever I find it. I almost hate to tell people about it because then its less for me!!! Dont ever stop making it or we will be picketing in front of your factory!! LOL"
36_bj,5,10.0,0.0,NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TARGET RUNS OUT. HELP! RUINED FOR ALL OTHER ICE CREAM
36_bj,3,12.0,2.0,"This is a tough one for me. I’ve tried 3 pints of this and the flavor is great. The chocolate ice cream base is perfect. It’s rich and creamy. The flavor of peanut butter and cookie swirls is also really really good. My problem is with how hard the swirls are. In my 3 pints, they were so hard that I could barely crack them with my spoon and they come out in one really big mass which makes eating the ice cream a bit of a wrestling match. But it all tastes SO good! It’s really decedent and rich and extremely filling. I will continue to buy it, I just wish it was easier to eat."
36_bj,5,15.0,0.0,"PLEASE sell this product in other places aside from target. Half the time they are out. If you havent tried it, you must. Love, love love."
36_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"Im addicted!! Target shows this is an ""exclusive & limited"" flavor...PLEASE...dont get rid of this!!!"
36_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I can only find this at Target. From the first bite I immediately consumed the whole pint. Totally worth it. I love peanut butter Swirls and ice cream and the nice cookie crunch was a pleasant surprise. This is the only ice cream I will eat from now on
36_bj,5,3.0,0.0,This ice cream is amazing. Never ever get rid of it!!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I was shopping at target about 3 weeks ago, and Im a peanut butter junkie, seen thus out of the corner of my eye. that night tried it the peanut butter infused, with cookie crunch, and chocolate ice cream, holy moly... my only upset is they only had 2 and since then I have not been able to find at either Meijers, Wal-Marts, and target has not received more so Im dieing over here. If ur a peanut butter, chocolate with a cookie crunch person this is the best combo to date"
36_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"What a wonderful combination! I thought you couldnt beat the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, but you totally did when you added chocolate cookie swirls to the mix. Thank you! Please keep making this flavor, it is my favorite by far!"
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is incredible! Please take this off the special edition list and make it a regular flavor. It is perfection! Perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter are delicious, and the PB swirls are exactly what I’ve been looking for. No other company makes an ice cream flavor like this. I have been buying it every time I go to Target. In fact it has increased my overall ice cream sales significantly. Thank you!! Please keep this flavor in circulation."
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I got this randomly when I was at target one day and Im in love! Hands down the best chocolate peanut butter ice cream ever. I do usually get it at target because its cheaper there... but the grocery store next to my house does sell it!
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is a MUST. I tried it for the first time about a month ago. Ive been looking for it ever since. EUREKA!!! I found it again yesterday and bought two. I so love this flavor! THANK YOU for being so wonderful.
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,SO good! I would make a special trip to Target just to get this. VERY glad that B&J resisted putting hard chunks in this flavor like they do in so many of their flavors. This is rich and chewy and perfect.
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I love all Ben and Jerry’s and this is my absolute favorite! I’ve been stocking up since it’s an exclusive. I would hate to see this flavor go, definitely should be added to the list of full time flavors!!"
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,And it’s not even close! Just wish it was everywhere instead of just at Target. Three times I have planned on making it last multiple evenings. All three times I finished the whole pint in one sitting.
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This might be the best flavor of ice cream ever!! Please consider selling it at non Target locations so everyone can get their hands on this! At the very least, dont stop selling it there!"
36_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is the only flavor I buy anymore. It is the epitome of ice cream. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise.
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor. I go out of my way to Target to buy it and no other ice cream compares. Please make this one full time and expand it to Walmart or something!! Its the perfect combination of salty and sweet, peanut butter and chocolate. The cookie crunch is the icing on the... ice cream. Anyway, its wonderful."
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I saw this flavor on the website and went to my local Target to get it. I was in love after my first bite. I love the combination of the peanut butter and rich chocolate ice cream. The cookie swirl is so good! Please dont stop making this flavor. It is one of your best in my opinion. This is my new favorite flavor!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Its. So. Good. Definitely the best flavor to come out in a long time! But please make it available in places other than Target. Its inconvenient to get to and they never stock enough of this flavor. Give the people what they want! More Peanut Butter World!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Im always searching for ice cream with peanut butter and often disappointed by the sparse amounts of peanut butter. The peanut butter world ice cream has the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate. I hope this flavor remains available!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I never have to think about it if someone asks me my favorite ice cream flavor - its Peanut Butter World, hands down! I really wish I could find it in more stores than Target. It is the perfect ice cream flavor. Please never stop making it!"
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Made a special trip to target just to try all the new flavors and so far this is my favorite! If you like peanut butter you will love this! I think I’m going to need to make another hour trip to target again to get more!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best ice cream ever. It’s the only flavor I eat. The peanut butter is the very best flavor and the cookie texture is the bomb. I wish it wasn’t exclusive and I could find it more places. Love love love this.
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Just found this flavor today and ate the whole pint already. I love Peanut Butter Fudge Core and this is soooo much creamier and the cookies add a nice texture. Please don’t take this one away!!!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavour is amazing! It’s like my favourite parts of the Tonight Dough, in its own pint. Can you please bring this one to Canada? I promise we love PB in the great white north."
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is, without question, the best ice cream flavor in the world....and I consider myself an expert. I only wish I could find it at other spots besides Target."
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"PB World is my favorite ice cream flavor ever. Its hard to find on my town! If I cant find it, I go with my #2--Chocolate Fudge Brownie."
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Had never seen this one before but it changed my life. Been a B&Js fan for as long as I can remember and this is definitely my new #1!
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite ice cream flavor ever, and I’m addicted to ice cream! Only wish it was sold in more stores than just Target!!"
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is my new favorite! I hope Ben & Jerrys always carries Peanut Butter World because it makes the world a better place :)
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This was an example of heaven on Earth. By far the best ice cream flavor yet to be invented. 14/10 recommend.
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,please never take this flavor away its amazing im so inlove with it please keep it 10/10
36_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best flavor Ben and Jerrys has come out with!
37_bj,5,22.0,6.0,"I feel like Im literally addicted to Ben and Jerrys Phish Food! It seems as if I cant get enough of the super creamy chocolate ice cream with the heavenly swirls of Marshmallow and Carmel throughout it and the wonderful little bonuses of fudge fish that are so ""chocolatey"" that they quench my desires & cravings!! But then as I start to see my spoon scraping the bottom of the container I rush to my freezer just to make sure Ive got 1 more pint of Phish Food in there for later!!! Phish Food has all the ""bells & whistles"" that will please any ice cream chocohlic!!! My final words: Ben and Jerrys Phish Food Ice Cream is DAMNDIDDLYICIOUS!!!!!!! (my made up word for very delicious)"
37_bj,5,8.0,0.0,"I cannot speak more highly of this flavour. I love that it has the perfect balance of both taste and texture: The sweet and soft marshmallow swirls, offset by the mildly bitter and crunchy fudge fish, and tied together with caramel. I usually eat a whole pint on my own, and would save each ""phish"" so I get one in each spoonful towards the end. I always wish there was more! Nevertheless, its still my favourite flavour, and I hope it doesnt get forgotten or overshadowed by the newer products. This brand is so expensive in my country, but I still save up and buy it as often as I can. Its THAT good."
37_bj,5,10.0,0.0,"Sometimes I think, man, Ben and Jerrys is kinda expensive... then I see this flavor on the shelf and Im ready to go in debt. Let me just say, you guys need to put marshmallows in your ice cream more often (in recipes that make sense of course lol). The texture for this ice cream is wonderful and I really think its because of the marshmallows. I have never bought Phish Food and been unsatisfied. And the thing is: I dont even care for chocolate ice cream. Its the flavor I always come back to, even when I swear to try something different."
37_bj,5,14.0,0.0,"I have never been a fan of any chocolate-based ice cream, but phish food (& b&j fudge brownie) is the exception. It is the perfect combination of ingredients. Best dessert Ive even had."
37_bj,5,4.0,1.0,I tried this for the first time last week and holy cow!! This pregnant girl is never getting another dessert
37_bj,5,7.0,0.0,This is our favorite flavor in our household!!! Im obsessed w the ooey gooey marshmallows with a scoop of a phish and a Carmel swirl mmmm.... if only I can buy a bag of the chocolate fish they put in there!! That would be even more amazing! Is there anyway to just get the little chocolate fish?? ;) my fiancé would be ecstatic! Haha hes always digging for the fish in my pint
37_bj,5,6.0,2.0,"One day I was in an extra curricular activity and a friend of mine was placing Phish Food in the freezer. It was a hot day and I am basically okay with any kind of ice cream so I asked if I could have it and she said, Sure. I went and grabbed a plastic spoon from the cabinet, opened the pint, and stuck the spoon in scooping up some ice cream. Before that moment I thought all ice cream was more or less similar. Boy, was I wrong! After tasting that first spoon full, I knew it was the most amazing ice cream I ever tasted!"
37_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"Oh my god! My new favorite! I cannot say enough about how good this one is. The fudgy chocolate ice cream, the fudge chunks and the copious amounts of marshmallow and caramel! I’m making myself hungry for it so I need to stop typing this. IT. IS. SO. GOOD!"
37_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Ben and Jerrys ice cream has always been a source of Unique flavors, but none as uniquely perfect as Phish Food. Ive been eating Phish Food ice cream since I can remember. No flavor has yet to match it and Ive tried a lot of ice cream."
37_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"You can fight me on this but you’re wrong. Phish Food is the best flavor ever made. And not just by Ben and Jerry’s, but any company in the history of the freezer case. Nothing comes close to this ridiculous combination of chocolate, fudge, marshmallow and caramel. I am so thankful for this ice cream!"
37_bj,5,8.0,2.0,This ice cream is so amazing with the marshmallow swirls and fudge fish! Please make a Non-Dairy/Vegan Phish food so I can enjoy this creation but as a vegan!
37_bj,5,4.0,2.0,"Arguably the best Ben and Jerrys flavor, its possible to eat an entire pint alone and not notice until the spoon scrapes the bottom. Its that good. The little fish are adorable, AND they taste like the best chocolate ever. I wish I could buy them by the bag, their perfectly melt in your mouth amazing. Add the caramel and marshmellow and its super sweet, but doesnt pass the line of Too Sweet. Much love to Ben & Jerry for their amazing ice cream!"
37_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I always check for ""new"" flavors or ""limited batch"" selections, however Phish Food is my go-to! My absolute favorite flavor....the gooey caramel and marshmallow swirls and the fudge fish are magical!"
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Phish food is the most amazing tasting ice cream I have ever had. Even better than homemade ice cream from the ice cream parlour. The chocolate ice cream base is rich and creamy, with just the perfect amount of marshmallow and caramel swirls. The chocolate fish are amazing, they a a slightly darker flavor than the chocolate ice cream making for a tasty chocolaty combination that is not too sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy my insasasionable craving for chocolate."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I am completely addicted to this ice cream. This was the first Ben and Jerrys ice cream I ever tried and I have tried others but none compare to this masterpiece. I dont see it in the case everytime I go to the grocery store so whenever I happen to pass by it and notice its there its a MUST BUY! The combination of the chocolatey ice cream and thick marshmallow swirls with the fudge fish is enough to send anyone over the edge. Amazing!
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My husband was trying to do something nice for me and buy me ice cream while I was busy trying to eat ""healthy food."" He came home with Phish Food and I said: ""naw, I dont think Ill like it. You can eat it."" And then he opened it and shoved it in my hands with a spoon. I tried two bites I was sold. Now I have dreams about this ice cream and wont buy or eat anything else. Im hooked for life!"
37_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Very sweet, but great combination of flavors and textures."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My go-to flavor when ever Im sick, sad, grumpy, or just in need of a pick me up! The marshmallow swirls come up and are like sweet little Angel kissed. The caramel swirls are sticky gooey globs of yummmmm and the chocolate chunks - shaped like fish - can make anyone giggle."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This has been my favorite ice cream for years. They did away with those little cylindrical problematic marshmallows and replaced it with dreamy fluff. The caramel is always physics defyingly gooey, and the soft crunchy fudge fish are always a delightful surprise."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love all ben and Jerry’s but somehow always end up going back to this one!! The caramel and gooey marshmallow mix together way better than I would have thought and the crunch of the frozen chocolate breaks it up for another added flavor.
37_bj,4,4.0,3.0,the flavour was so good that i had to buy it again! strongly recommended.
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I was introduced to Phish Food about 4 years ago. I absolutely love it! It is the only flavor of B&Js Ice Cream I have tried and I have no desire to try others because I am pretty sure this is the best. Wont you agree with me?
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favourite ice cream in the WORLD! I love the chocolate phish, I wish you could buy a bag of them separately so I can keep adding extra to the ice cream. PLEASE bring out bags of phish chocolates!! X"
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Probably the most amazing mix of flavors in 1 pint. This mix is every possible thing you could want in ice cream. Believe me when I say if you havent tried it, it should be 1st on your bucket list."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is my everything. Once ate a gallon In a month. It is so amazing and you will not regret buying a pint (or 50)!!!!! It is so incredibly good, and eating it is indescribable euphoria."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Seriously. . . I was NEVER an ice cream fan. Didnt like it. Never craved it. That all changed when I was introduced to Phish Food! *Game Changer*!! Love this ice cream. Love, Love, Love."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"YEARS ago Phish Food came as a novelty ice cream on a stick. It was somehow even better this way! I loved it because when I had a craving for it, no waiting, unwrap and devour!!!"
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I’ve been getting this flavor since I was a little girl. I love the chocolate fish and the marshmallow cream. So yummy it will always be a special flavor to me
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I always thought chocolate ice cream was a pale imitation of the real thing until I tasted Phish Food. This stuff should be considered an opioid, its so good."
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I’ve been getting phish food ever since I was little, and every time I get it I get flashbacks of when I was a child. Phish food is by far my favorite flavor."

37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Huge favorite of both me and my three sons! (they are triplets.) Delicious chocolate ice cream with some caramel. The chocolate fish are also delicious!

37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I get this all the time since a kid. The chocolate flavor is so pure and delicious, I crave it! Totally worth the try. Yum yum yum"
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,No really she left me for this ice cream. I told her she had to choose between Phish Food and me and I guess its that good.
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is one of my absolute favorite flavors! It tastes delicious and I would eat it every night if I could!

37_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"When I was younger, this was my absolute favorite!"
37_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite flavor ever!!! The combination is perfect!
38_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"I have had great, mediocre, and yucky ice cream/gelato all around the states and several different countries, and this is by far my very, very all-time favourite as the quality creamy ice cream has a cool subtle pistachio flavour and it is loaded with tons of toasted perfect nuts! What could be better than that? Sadly, I now live in Montreal, and have checked every ice cream selling market/deppaneur/etc. and cannot find this flavour anywhere! I need my fix! This is torture! (....and I don’t understand how we have such a huge French and Italian population here, why this is not one of the few flavours sold here!). :("
38_bj,5,9.0,1.0,"This is my all-time favorite store-bought ice cream/flavor! Having been to Italy several times, Ive had my share of amazing pistachio gelato. B&Js does it even better as you have the smooth, creamy lightly pistachio-flavored ice cream and lots of toasted pistachios for that great crunch within the creamy......perfection! Sadly, Ive never been to a B&Js that offers this flavor, and it is pretty difficult to find in grocery stores and drug stores. So....when you do.....nab them all! :D Youre welcome! (.....everyone always thanks me for turning them onto this flavor!)"
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is our family’s favorite I’ve cream EVER! It has the perfect lightly nutty flavouring and a delicious, satisfying crunch of toasted pistachios throughout! Every bite is as good as the first! Sadly, I have not found this anywhere in my new home of Montreal, Quebec as the stores always only of the same few flavours (I’m guessing as branding for both French and English up here is costly). However, it surprises me that this is not one of the few options uphere as we have a huge European population (that, of course, loves pistachios). I would think it would be a huge hit! Sadly, B&J’s can’t ship time either? Sincerely, Heartbroken in Canada (a.k..a. Diana ;) )"
38_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"OK guys, I put on 30 pounds because of this stuff. It was worth it on one hand, because its so amazingly delicious, but now Im huge. Oh well. Ill lose some weight as long as this is waiting for me as an occasional treat."
38_bj,3,3.0,0.0,"Ive consumed about 10 pints of this over the past 5 years. When its good, meaning all the nuts are healthy, its very, very good. Its pretty good when one or two nuts are a bit off. But tonight I chewed into the most rancid, putrid pistachio of my entire life. Nearly hurled. Will not purchase again."
38_bj,5,2.0,0.0,B&Js Pistachio Pistachio is my all-time favorite ice cream - ever!!! The creamy smooth flavored ice cream and the crunchy salty nuts always give me exactly what my taste buds are craving. I remember the first time I ever tried this - I thought I died and went to heaven! <3 True Perfection <3
38_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is the ONLY ice cream I buy and I have tried all the pastachio flavors of different brands. I will drive the extra couple miles just to get this stuff. I dont see how anyone could rate this one star.
38_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I have been eating Pistachio-Pistachio for several years and never grow tired of it. My favorite and before that is was New York Super Chunk. It takes a great deal to pull me away from good chocolate
38_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Anything less than 5 Stars don’t appreciate pistachios.. the guy who compliains that the nuts are too hard... Obviously is not a nut lover. This is a must if you enjoy crunch and nuts
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream falls into the category of private joy for me. The superb flavor and variety of texture between the silky ice cream and chewy pistachios elevate me to another plane. My ultimate indulgence is to sip a glass of scotch along with a bowl (I try to keep it small!) of this wonderful confection. An adult treat!
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I guess everyone can make a lemon, but I havent encountered one yet in the Pistachio Pistachio flavor. Especially like the salted pistachio mixed with the vanilla. The pistachios were good and fresh in all the pints Ive had. Always look for it on the shelf now. Keep up the good work!"
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I’m mean, here I am about to dig into another pint for the first time, and of course it’s excellent, just like the majority of the other ones. The ice cream itself is delicious; creamy and pistachioey and the pistachios are perfect. Killer pint! Thanks again guys!"
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"My favorite!! I would never give less than five stars for Ben and Jerrys, however I think the last batch of this amazing ice cream was light on the pistachio... Usually full of them this one only had maybe ten total!! Still the best around."
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I didn’t have really high expectations when I bought this today but after tasting it just now I am headed back to the store to buy all of the containers. I’m pretty sure that if everyone ate some of this then there would be peace on earth!
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Everyone in my house has their own ice cream and this is my all time fav. I love that i dont have to share lmao. Plus my 5 year old knows what to get me when she and daddy go to the store. # MyGuiltyPleasure
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I always stick to the same kind of ice cream but recently I decided to try something new and now Im addicted. I buy a pint of Pistachio Pistachio at least twice a week if not more and I dont care :)
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite flavor ever! Ever since I tried this flavor, I rarely pick another. It has a great sweet flavor to balace it out with the roasted pistachios. Its indulgent without being too rich."
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I usually buy pistachio gelato at the local ice cream store but I was in Publix at the time. This pistachio is by far the BEST I have ever had! You will not be disappointed!
38_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I always use to buy Karmel Sutra. But I thought I try this one. Its great!!!
39_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"I absolutely love the blueberry cheesecake but cant find it anymore. I stumbled across Pumpkin Cheesecake at Albertsons in Wildomar, CA and this has to be the best Ben & Jerrys yet! My husband said hes ready to spend a ton of money to stock up. Its identical to actual pumpkin cheesecake! During the 110 degree temps its sooooo good! Ill be raving about this! Thank you for bringing back another amazing cheesecake flavor!"
39_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"This has been my favorite ice cream since 2008 when I first tasted this flavor. Since then, finding it was the worst experience ever! It is made in limited batches, and was NEVER in the same store every year, so you became an explorer to find it each year! Was it in Walmart, Wegmans, Shop Rite, CVS, or where every September? I knew this was the time the first batch was delivered! FINALLY, this year they have a specific page on their website for Pumpkin Cheesecake. All you have to do is put in your zip code, and it will tell you where is the nearest establishment to purchase this in incredibly, tasty, scrumptiously delicious frozen treat!!! Good luck, and be careful of brain freeze! Youre gonna love it!!!"
39_bj,5,10.0,0.0,This is my favorite ice cream flavor ever. I usually buy dozens of pints to stock up every fall!
39_bj,1,5.0,4.0,"I bought this last weekend, I am not sure how but it was still available at a local Walmart. I have been wanting to try this flavor, and figured it was long gone, but to my surprise I was able to find it, so I figured it was a sign from above. Overall, the pumpkin flavor tastes familiar... But over seasoned... It is a bit boring, and honestly this ice cream could be amazing. The graham cracker swirl is more of a.... occasional chunk. Honestly, the graham cracker swirl was to die for!! It was the highlight of this ice cream... If they could just add more swirl, I would be much more impressed overall. The swirl definitely breaks up the boredum of the ice cream, it is a bit repetitive. I think a huge glob of swirl would be amazing."
39_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I just bought this flavor from target.. i went there to get chunky monkey but they were all out. Ive tried every other flavor and this was the LAST pint of this flavor. I like pumkin pie but its not my favorite... i love all of B&J’s cheesecake flavors so i thought i mayyyyy like this one.......
39_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I Baught this in Brattleboro Vermont while looking at their delicious ice cream! & oh my gosh! Its a complete favorite! Cant get enough!!
39_bj,5,5.0,0.0,I couldnt believe it! Who would have thought something so simple in a pint would be heaven in your mouth? Omg amazing!!
39_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This taste great. I wait every year for the pumpkin ice cream to come out. So glad it comes out a little bit early. Pumpkin ice creams are my favorite and this one is delicious.
39_bj,5,2.0,0.0,So smooth and and delicious every chance I had I bought 4 of them!
39_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Simply the best! I wish this was available year round
39_bj,4,3.0,1.0,Great flavor. Tastes like pumpkin cheesecake blended into ice cream. The swirl is gritty and has great texture.
39_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Last time I had it bought the last 2 pints @ Walmart in Puerto Rico a couple of years ago. It was the last time since never seen it again anywhere.
39_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Came across this gem in Walmart and fell in love. The one thing that would make it perfect is a little more of the graham cracker crust.
39_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Makes Pumpkin spice season worth it! I always try to buy tons but it never lasts :/
40_bj,3,10.0,4.0,"i give this icecream a 3 star. because 5 js licking spoon to its core. 4 is not enough chunks but yummy creamy icecream flavor. 3 is.... well this. def not enough cookie or strawberry. and not enough blueberry icecream flavor. needs LOTS more. tasted like vanilla icream with very rare moments of tastebud excitement when the tiny chunks of shortbread were finally dug up. Did i eat it in 2 days? yes. Did i enjoy eating it? yes. Did i look forward to wating it in the future? no i forgot about it which means it wasnt great. Will i buy again? if they advertise it after this review "" with an overload of added chunks"".... ps.. looks nothing like the picture smh :("
40_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"I read the description of this flavor and thought this might be an instant classic. Raspberry and blueberry ice cream? And strawberries too? Ooh! But I have to say this flavor was a disappointment. All I could taste was vanilla and the shortbread. Now blueberry isnt the strongest flavor in the world, but you would think it could be amped up at least a little. And maybe its just me but I could not taste the raspberry at all. And the pint I purchased had only a few bites of strawberry. The flavor was not bad, but it was nothing like i was expecting. Instead of ""wow!"", all I experienced was ""meh"". Ill stick with my old favorites and keep hoping for a resurrection of ""Thats My Jam""."
40_bj,5,8.0,2.0,"Okay as I said in another review. I bought this with 2 other flavors(Sammie flavor and the sweet like sugar flavor), and I was the most leery of this flavor. As I tend to enjoy fresh blue and raspberries as opposed to having them in ice creams. As they just dont taste right or good to me. But in this flavor. Im not sure if it was the fact that there was the vanilla swirl and short bread cookies, that balanced things out or what. But this turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Again, I know others may not like it, because its not one of B&Js chunck induced, fudge freckled classics. But its definitely a step in the right direction in balancing out more natural even flavors, with deep, rich, and sometimes too salty flavors as well. So definitely keep mixing it up for sure."
40_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"The vanilla itself isnt even that great tasting and vanilla is all this ice cream flavour really is. The blueberry and raspberry portion of ice cream taste just like the vanilla, the strawberry pieces are few and far between, and the short bread chunks were about the same. The ice cream could be a great flavour if they reworked it and added some more flavour to the blue ice cream portion and adding a little more chunks of fruit and cookies."
40_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"If you tripled the amount of shortbread, at least, I could give this a 3 star rating. But it also hardly had any strawberry; maybe 5 tiny little pieces(but thats a stretch) Raspberry? Where? That was non existent. And the blueberry could also be kicked up a notch... Also, just take out the vanilla all together. Other than the name, there is no need for it."
40_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I have bought 3 of these! So delicious. Sometimes I find the flavors overwhelming so this is a great one for people like me who enjoy ice cream but not crazy amounts of different flavor.
40_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"If you ate this with your eyes closed, you would swear it’s vanilla with an occasional chunk of something that you couldn’t really place. Good vanilla, but...vanilla."
40_bj,3,1.0,0.0,Wasn’t gross because it’s ice cream. :-p. However I was very disappointed. Tasted very plain like vanilla. Not a lot of chunks either. Not fruity at all.
40_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"I enjoyed it but could be better. more shortbread chunks, more strawberries, and stronger blueberrie taste"
40_bj,2,1.0,0.0,Usually love Ben and Jerry’s so I Thought this would be great but ended up being kind of tasteless.
40_bj,5,1.0,0.0,the best ice cream ive ever had! i bought it once and couldnt find it again
41_bj,5,29.0,0.0,"This has long been my favorite Ben and Jerrys flavor - the chocolate ice cream in it is deep, dark and delicious, the graham crumb swirl adds just the right bit of texture, the ""toasted marshmallow"" is more complex than the straight-up marshmallow in Phish Food, and the chunks of chocolate are of the highest quality. Sadly it is hard to find in my area - I look for it in any store I go into and when I find it, buy as many cartons as can fit in my freezer! I tried the new Limited Edition ""Gimme SMore"" flavor and found it very disappointing. I certainly hope Ben and Jerrys isnt planning to replace the classic Smores with this new flavor - Id be heartbroken!"
41_bj,5,16.0,0.0,"I could eat ice cream everyday and am a bit of a chocoholic, so naturally this is my go to flavor for Ben and Jerrys. Although there are several other chocolate based flavors, its hard to compare and I went through serious withdraw when I couldnt buy it when living in the U.K. While this used to be easy to find in my local grocery stores, Ive recently seen it replaced with the new Gimme Smore flavor on the shelves. I am hoping that it isnt going to be discontinued, as the new flavor is completely different. Never one to write reviews, but I feel so passionately that I wanted it to be stated that some of us out there love this one, despite the lower rating."
41_bj,5,13.0,0.0,"This is my all-time FAVORITE ice cream flavor--period. Ben & Jerrys is terrific, but they have far outdone themselves with Smores. Nothing else compares. Its been my favorite ice cream since I was a kid, and nothing has ever come close to replacing it. Unfortunately, it also happens to be the MOST DIFFICULT flavor to find. There are no retailers near me that still carry it--it seems to have been phased out, and I hope not in favor of ""Gimme Smore,"" which cant hold a candle to the original Smores. The rich chocolate flavor, punctuated by fudgy chocolate chunks; paired with velvety toasted marshmallow and delightfully crunchy, textured graham cracker swirls--nothing compares!"
41_bj,5,26.0,1.0,"This is by far my favorite ice cream ever. I dont know what it is, but I am totally addicted to it and will pretty much eat the entire pint in one sitting, even though I dont like eating ice cream that much. Ive driven long distances to buy this and was on the website right now just to find out where I can buy this since I just moved to a new state. I was shocked to see that this has some negative reviews and I felt that I should pay the ice cream back by writing this review. But anyway, best ice cream ever."
41_bj,1,33.0,32.0,"The main problem with this flavor is that it has a very poor balance between the three components of a smore: graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow. In its current iteration, the chocolate ice cream base completely overpowers everything else to the point where youre left with what tastes like plain chocolate ice cream. I would suggest completely reinventing this flavor with a graham cracker flavored ice cream base, with chocolate chunks and a much more generous amount of marshmallow swirl. I think this flavor has the potential to be a fantastic, stand-out flavor, but as it stands I will not be buying it again."
41_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"I love Ben and Jerry’s. There are a few flavors in particular that I call Melters. This is because I melt into euphoria at the first bite. There are a few that are so good that with the first spoonful I am in heaven. This S’mores ice cream is perfect in my opinion. The chocolate base (B&J does chocolate better than anyone) is dense, rich, sweet, and decedent. The graham and toasted marshmallow play perfectly together and create layers that come apart while spooning, and with the fudge chunks, and this effect makes the pint ridiculously delicious! Just FYI, the other melters are Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Phish Food, Chocolate Therapy, Half Baked, Gimme Smore, Tonight Dough, Peanut Butter World and Chubby Hubby."
41_bj,5,16.0,0.0,"Smores is by far my favorite B&Js flavor. I was upset to see the other reviews saying they were so disappointed! Maybe it was something in a recent batch or whatever, but anytime I get it, its always perfect! The graham cracker swirls are the best part. So delicious!"
41_bj,5,14.0,1.0,"Im in love with Smores. In fact, I fell in love with my husband over a pint of Smores. As teenagers, we shared spoonfuls of the richest chocolate, creamiest marshmallows and bites of graham cracker perfection. 15 years later, we still go ""gaga"" when we spot it in a store. My only wish is that we could find it more often--its certainly hard to come by in the tristate area."
41_bj,5,4.0,0.0,Ever since I was a baby I have loved this flavor. When we did a vote in our family about who was the messiest ice cream eater I was voted number one but especially with this flavor. I find this flavor my very favorite and I think that no other flavor is even close in the good range. Youre in heaven when you eat it. It has the perfect amount of every flavor. I love it! Definitely a must in your freezer!
41_bj,5,5.0,0.0,There aren’t enough stores that carry this flavor! There aren’t nearly enough chocolate based b&j flavors but this one is perfect! The roasted marshmallow is so good & the graham is delicious. The only thing I might recommend would be to add more graham ... and to get more stores to carry it!
41_bj,5,4.0,0.0,My absolute favorite flavor of Ben & Jerrys! The chocolate ice cream as always is delicious. Smores ice cream should always have a chocolate base. I love the texture of the chunks of chocolate and graham crackers. Im glad they chose to go with a whipped marshmallow rather than fluffy marshmallow chunks. This flavor really cant be beat!
41_bj,5,5.0,0.0,"Its not like I can find it anywhere anymore but, its still my favorite. Hopefully B&J will get with the program and have it more widely available in NYC again!"
41_bj,1,21.0,10.0,Cannot even taste the graham cracker or marshmallow. I taste more marshmallow in the Phish Food. Chocolate should not be the base of this ice cream it completely overpowers anything else that could be there. Id recommend a graham cracker ice cream with ample swirls of marshmallow and fudge as a remake of this flavor
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Phish Food used to be my favorite, until I first had Smores. Now I cant get enough of it. For some reason it only appears to be sold in Publix in my area, so I have to make the extra trek to Publix just to get me some Smores. The problem is they sell out of it frequently so I have to check back often. Very well balanced and frankly addictive. Please expand the retail distribution so all the smores fans in my area dont have to fight for the limited inventory at Publix. THANKS!"
41_bj,5,5.0,0.0,I look for the Smores every time I hit the grocer. Now to find the ever elusive Smores Ice Cream bar!
41_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"This particular flavor has to be one of my favorites I absolutely love the marshmallow swirl and the graham cracker pieces.The chocolate chunks were good too though I wish the pieces were a little bit smaller, still, wont stop me from getting this ice cream."
41_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This is my addiction! I love its more a semi sweet chocolate with the marshmallow and graham cracker... I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop making this ice cream. I call dibs on the recipe if you ever discontinue!
41_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I die of sadness every time I’m in the mood for B&J, but the store doesn’t carry this flavor...it has ALL THE THINGS...delish chocolate ice cream, graham cracker crack bits, and sweet, sweet toasted marshmallow swirls. One of the few foods in life that is worth the calories...when I see people give this flavor a low score I literally want to fist fight them."
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"So this was my favorite ice cream ever!!! all the flavors match so well and the combination of the chocolate ice cream with the graham cracker is great. If I could ask for anything would be to have a little more graham cracker in it, but is still absolutely delicious. However Im deeply sad to see that this flavor is no longer available... just so disappointing and now Im struggling to find another ice cream to substitute my favorite ever Smores! :("
41_bj,5,4.0,0.0,head and shoulders the best of the bunch. why so hard to find?
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"When I was living in NYC, I found this flavor one time in my local bodega. Ever since then, its been my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor. I recently moved back to Michigan and cannot find it anywhere! The graham cracker swirls balance out the decadent chocolate flavors and the toasted marshmallow adds this gooey element that is perfectly complex and sweet. Luckily, when I visit my boyfriend who is stationed in North Dakota, his store carries it and Im able to get my fix. I hope this flavor never gets discontinued!"
41_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I just melt when I dig into certain B&J flavors and this is one of them. Everything about S’mores is great, I just wish the marshmallow and graham swirls were thicker. This is a great pint and I will definitely be buying it again."
41_bj,5,3.0,0.0,My husband and I drive all the way across town to buy this ice cream at least twice a week! It is the BEST! I love that is is very chocolatey with a hint of marshmallow and graham cracker. Its perfection!
41_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"If you are like me and enjoy Smores, you will not be disappointed with this pint. I have read some of the bad reviews and I think people have come across some imbalanced pints, but that it no way should take away from what this flavor is at its best. I have had imbalanced pints in every flavor and chalk it up to nuances in the manufacturing process. This one may be slightly more prone to imbalances, but the flavor is so good that I am more than willing to put up with a few ""misses"" from time to time."
41_bj,5,5.0,1.0,"PLEASE, this is my favorite flavor and if it went away I dont know what I would do, the graham cracker chunks are heaven and everything about this spells happiness."
41_bj,5,5.0,1.0,I love this ice cream. I wish they sold it in a bigger size. I would literally buy gallons of this stuff. Best flavor ever!
41_bj,5,3.0,0.0,I love chocolate ice creams and this is my favorite of them all..
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I accidentally bought the ""new"" smores flavor thinking it was this one. This one has much better flavor. It tastes like Smores because it has marshmallow and Graham cracker and chocolate. The new one tastes like vanilla ice cream with Oreo cookie pieces. Nothing Smores about it."
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is one of my favorite flavors. So chocolaty! I love the marshmallow and graham cracker flavor too!
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Love the toasted flavor in the marshmallow and overall is one of my favorite flavors!
41_bj,5,2.0,0.0,First time trying smores ice cream and I love it!
41_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"Im a long time Ben and jerries fan, and Ive never been let down by any of the flavors, until this one. In the entire pint I only got one bite of marshmallow, which is not what I expected from and ice cream named smores. It would have been an excellent flavor if it had more marshmallow and graham crackers in it."
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Oh my goodness this is my favorite ice cream ever. The chocolate ice cream base tastes dark, which is so rare and hard to find. I absolutely love it and cant get enough. Thank you! I hope you never change the recipe."
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream combines everything I love about smores. The chocolate ice cream is a perfect choice for the base--creamy, rich, delicious. Ben and Jerrys has managed to create an amazing gooey marshmallow with a real toasted marshmallow flavor. I go crazy over that marshmallow swirl. Im also crazy for the graham cracker bits--they add some amazing texture to the ice cream that I love, and have great flavor. Then, to top it all off, the crunchy chocolate bits. This is a great ice cream if you like texture in your ice cream, and I do. This is fun to eat, and totally delicious. This is an ice cream you have to stop after the first bite (and the 20th!) to say ""Wow, thats good."" Side note--I tried ""Gimmie Smores"" and found it frankly dull. It tasted like generic cookies and cream ice cream. It wasnt rich and decadent and exciting like this. Smores is a far superior ice cream. Also, the Campfire ice cream hits some similar notes but still isnt as good. I dont like nuts, and I appreciate having some amazing ice creams that dont rely on those for interest. This is the real winner."
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best combination of flavors! We love this ice cream so much and it is impossible to find. Really hoping it is not replaced with the new Gimme S’mores flavor which is not great.
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I took one spoonful of this and fell in love. I could not stop eating until I reached the bottom. Hope this never goes away. Did not have any marshmallows, but I was too in love to care."
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best flavor in my opinion but it not stocked very well in the KY area. Makes it very hard to find!!! Please fix guy!
41_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite flavor! Lately I haven’t been able to find it anywhere. I want s’more!!!

42_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I just bought this today! The most perfect Ben and Jerry blend and I have been trying all of them! Im also sad/scared that its an exclusive flavor. Please dont take it away from me.
42_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I love this flavor! I got it on a whim and Im so glad it paid off!! I hope they come out with slices next! This is hands down my favorite one!! Im over here trying not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. Only suggestion is a little more almond flavor/slices (or chocolate covered almonds) in the pint. Either way, I love it!"
42_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This was reccomended to me last night at a store in napa and I dont write reviews for much but I had to for this one. Hands down the best ice cream Ive ever had. Sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy and the best flavor ever. I hope I can find it in stores! Love love love it!"

42_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I bought this flavour for a friend who loves salted caramel and fell in love! I feel like the name just doesn’t do justice to the deliciousness within. Crunchy almonds, crispy chocolate, and caramel swirls that aren’t overly sweet - just perfection!"

43_bj,5,6.0,0.0,I’m convinced this flavor of ben and jerry’s will create world peace. I hope it comes in slices/bar form or any other kind! NEED TO STOCK MY FREZER FULL! i eat this while binging netflix!
43_bj,5,7.0,0.0,"I have been absolutely in love with this stuff every since the first time I tried it about 7 years ago. I have tried other brands of strawberry cheesecake ice cream when the store was out of ben & jerrys brand, and Ben & Jerrys is far superior to those because most of them use a strawberry jelly-like swirl instead of actual chunks of strawberry like Ben & Jerrys."
43_bj,3,7.0,1.0,"I love the idea of a strawberry cheesecake ice cream, but only one of those components really shine here. The strawberry flavor greatly overpowers the cheesecake, resulting in what tastes like a sweeter strawberry ice cream than a true hybrid. The graham cracker crumbs are a stand out, but even then, theres not quite enough. A decent flavor."
43_bj,1,23.0,13.0,This used to be my favorite. I havent had it in 5 years so when I saw that it had come back I didnt waste any time splurging on it. It tastes almost the same but feels really thick and weird. Thats probably because the cheesecake pieces were replaced with cheesecake flavored ice cream. Im so disappointed.
43_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Im a huge Ben & Jerrys fan, half baked was always my go to flavor since Im a chocolate fan. However, my boyfriend started getting strawberry cheesecake and after one bite, Ill never get any other flavor again. Its delicious, the graham crackers complete it. Would definitely recommend trying it! So refreshing."
43_bj,4,4.0,0.0,"I agree, very yummy, but need to double the amount of Graham cracker in it! Would be 5 stars if that happened!"
43_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I am a huge cheesecake fan, so obviously had to try this flavor. And I gotta say, I was definitely not disappointed. The base tastes so much like cheesecake..theres the perfect amount of strawberries throughout..and the graham swirl is just enough to be like a crust. Everything about this flavor is perfect. Im one who almost always adds some type of syrup for a topping, but this one doesnt need anything!"
43_bj,4,3.0,0.0,This is my favorite but I would love it even more if there was more crust in the ice cream. Sometimes I may get a pint and there is really no crust at all in it...
43_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I usually go for Chocolate Fudge Brownie or Half Baked because Im a chocolate freak.

43_bj,5,1.0,0.0,THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FLAVOUR I HAVE EVER TASTED. I NEED THIS TO BE AVAILABLE IN PINTS IN CANADA. I BELIEVE IT WOULD SELL WELL. BY SELL WELL I MEAN I WILL PROBABLY BUY EVERY SINGLE PINT AVAILABLE IF I COULD.
43_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this yesterday and managed to finish the wholle pint. This is by far one of my favorite Ben And Jerrys Ice cream flavors so far. If I could change anything I would add more strawberries.

43_bj,4,2.0,1.0,The flavor and premium quality ingredients are definitely superb except for the strawberries. They suck! Horrible texture! They gotta go! I spit them out when I eat this flavor.

44_bj,5,11.0,2.0,Ive been a huge fan of Phish food for 15 or more years. Its been my favorite. But this blew me away. I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to.
44_bj,5,13.0,1.0,"Havent been big on icecream in my life time. Only flavor I cared for was cookies and cream. Had no idea Id LOVE Choc flavor, and mixed with the carmel, such a divine combination. The cookie swirl is mouth watering. The cookie dough is exquisite; although țhe peanut butter dough is also scrumptious, I could live without much of it in the pint. Ive gotten pints with very little of the PB dough, which is heavenly. Ive also gotten pints with lots and lots of PB dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, its the flavor I always reach for. Still consider my FAV of all time. Thank you Ben & Jerrys, & Jimmy Fallon for perfecting a flavor so awesome."
44_bj,5,8.0,0.0,Honestly all I have to say is this is the best icecream Ive ever had. It had gobs of amazement in it. Like wow.

I love the cookie swirl and the peanut butter dough, I love the ice cream flavor, I love everything is what I’m saying - it’s perfect and B&J please don’t change a thing!! Everything But The... used to be my favorite flavor but they have definitely changed the formula there and I stopped buying it because all I could taste was my bitter memories of how it used to be. So glad I have a replacement flavor that I love even more!!"
44_bj,5,15.0,0.0,"I cannot stop talking to myself with my mouth full of ice cream saying, ""O my gawd, sooo good!"""
44_bj,2,5.0,4.0,"This ice cream is to be our favorite. We probably right once a week for a year. However the last five we have purchased have had a new taste to it of some sort of fruit, and it has ruined the flavor. We waited A few weeks to that that that sent out, and then we went and bought some more , But it was still the same weird through the aftertaste. For the aftertaste doesnt belong anywhere near brownies or cookies or chocolate ice cream or Oreos. Its gross. Please change the recipe back to the original !!!!!!! We have switched to a different brand of ice cream for now."
44_bj,2,6.0,1.0,The first time I bought this flavor it was amazing! But the last few times the peanut butter dough has ruined it. It tastes rancid. I keep giving it chances because I love everything else about it. But I had one last night that was rancid tasting PB again and my pile of PB chunks in the end was about 1/4 of the container worth. I dont believe Ill be giving it any more chances this time.
44_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"This ice cream is what I would heaven if it were a flavor. Send me truck loads, ASAP! Contact me for my info. :)"
44_bj,2,5.0,0.0,This ice cream is great except for the disgusting peanut butter dough chunks that taste like eating a ball of Splenda mixed with dish soap. Seems like maybe there is a bad batch going around? The rest of the pint is great... not sure what’s up.
44_bj,5,2.0,1.0,"I purchased Tonight Dough in a Ben and Jerrys shop hefe in Hawaii a few months ago... OMG it is the greatest flavor I have ever tasted! I am not even an ice cream person, but when I found out that my local grocery store carried the Tonight Dough in pints- I was hooked! The base of this ice cream is mostly chocolate with some caramel ice cream. Then you have globs of chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie dough. There is also swirls of thick chocolate fudge and tiny chuck of chocolate sandwich cookie pieces! The best way to eat this is to let it melt a bit and swirl it all around to mix up the choclate fudge and chocolate sandwich cookie peices. Great Job Ben and Jerrys - and Jimmy Falon! Honestly the only ice cream I will eat!"
44_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"This is a great ice cream in almost every way: the ice creams are delicious and the crunchy cookie swirls are awesome. The regular cookie dough with mini chocolate chips is also delicious. I was taken aback by the ""peanut butter dough"" though - it tasted really artificial, almost a bit rancid? I ate a few and had to pick the rest out. One of my friends was eating it too and felt the same. Please consider changing the PB dough or removing it altogether."
44_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Its like heaven in my mouth from the first spoonful to the last.
44_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Im still amazed that so many components can fit into one pint. The varied cookie dough pieces have the perfect chewiness. The rich chocolate base compliments the dough, and the cookie crumbs complete the overall theme. If I can find one flaw, its in the caramel ice cream, which is so minimal and over-powered by the chocolate base that it might as well have just been just chocolate. Still, one of B&Js best."
44_bj,4,3.0,0.0,"I love this flavor so much, the chocolate cookie swirl is so good. The two icecream flavors are sooo good! But i did not like the peanut butter dough I had way to many chunks and not enough chocolate Chip cookie dough pieces."
44_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Words cannot describe how delicious this flavor is. The cookie swirl along with the never ending chunks of cookie dough is absolutely amazing!
44_bj,3,4.0,1.0,"Im so disappointed because I wanted to try this one for a long time. Well, Im gonna have to agree with everyone who complained about the peanut butter cookie dough. I cant even describe the taste, but its certainly not peanut butter. Yuck!"
44_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"I really liked most of this one. The ice creams taste great as do all the mix-ins, except the peanut butter cookie dough, which has an extremely strange flavor, and not peanut buttery. It’s kind of frustrating because the rest of it is SO good. I’ll probably stick with Half Baked instead of getting this one again."
44_bj,1,4.0,3.0,I have been trying really hard to stay away from ice cream but saw this on the shelf and thought I have to try it. Boy was I disappointed. First I almost bent my spoon in half trying to break into the ice cream but that was because the cookie dough took over everything. There was hardly any ice cream in this. The dough pieces were very dry and not tasty at all. I really wish I could have liked this one. $5.00 in the garbage.
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive been dying to try this flavor and after trying a couple not so great flavors i decided it was time. it was the best decision of my entire life. if you only eat one ice cream for the rest of your life, let it be ""the tonight dough"". the dough chunks are not ""chunks"", theyre insanely huge, like nearing nestle Toulouse premade dough size. the ice creams are so good and its just amazing. i wish they sold this one in a barrel because one pint is just not enough!"
44_bj,1,13.0,10.0,I bought this with high hopes but the peanut butter cookie dough is disgusting. Everything else is fine with it except that. It tastes NOTHING like peanut butter cookie dough. Pretty unhappy considering how much this stuff costs....
44_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The first time I tried this ice cream it was amazing! I thought it was my new favorite. The second time I tried it it hardly had any cookie dough in it at all and was mostly ice cream. Then the third time I bought it it was loaded with cookie dough (yay) but was mostly all the peanut butter dough which made it too peanut buttery for me. Im not sure why it would be inconsistent because Ive never had that experience with other Ben and Jerry flavors.
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I was never really a big fan of ice cream but that was long before I bought my first pint of The Tonight Dough. Ever since I took a spoonful of this heavenly creation, Ive been addicted to eating it. Being a girl is tough for about a full week, once a month. I can now happily spend that week eating this ice cream. Its my guilty pleasure. Thank you, Jimmy Fallon for helping to create the single best thing that makes life worth living."
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Had a craving for some ice cream and hadnt had some B&Js in a while...picked up The Tonight Dough at my local Walmart...when I cracked it open and took my first bite, I fell in love!! I love Jimmy Fallon and I love ice cream...you took my 2 favorite things and put them together!! Quick question: Did he REALLY come up with this combo, cuz if he did, tell him he hit a home run with it!!....and please dont stop making/selling it!!!"
44_bj,3,3.0,1.0,It was mostly good except the peanut butter cookie dough had yucky aftertaste. My husband agreed. Unfortunately most of the chunks were peanut butter so we both had significant collections at the bottom of our pints. Normally I like anything sweet but they really were a bit nasty. The rest was delicious.
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Tried this one for the first time tonight after many glowing recommendations from my girlfriend. I cant believe I waited so long to try this batch of heaven! The cookie dough and peanut butter offer a delightful chewy texture and flavor alternate with the ice chocolate and caramel ice cream.
44_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I can’t find this in my stores for the last week! It’s constant,y sold out. I may have to put on a disguise and sneak into another county! I need more!"
44_bj,3,3.0,1.0,"This ice cream is soooo great! It would almost say it is my favorite however the PB cookie dough has an add taste to it that makes it undesirable. Almost a freezer burnt taste. I would recommend a new recipe for the dough. Otherwise, it is great!"
44_bj,3,2.0,1.0,"I was really enjoying this one up until I tasted a bit of the peanut butter dough. It tastes rancid. :( I thought perhaps it was that one piece, but sure enough it tasted the same when i found another piece! Bummer. It wouldve gotten 5 stars from me had it not been for those funky PB dough bits, yuck! Everything else in it was fabulous."
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Is it? Heaven in a pint? Seriously... Best icecream I have ever had. I Really hope it never gets discontinued... I live in Kauai, Hawaii only Walmart sells It. Its now the only icecream Ill eat!"
44_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Absolutely my favorite Ben and Jerrys ice cream flavor so far. I have yet to find another mouth-watering ice cream flavor that will impress me. I will be trying your new non dairy products very soon. Thanks for the creativity.
44_bj,1,2.0,1.0,Pb cookie dough was terrible. Had to force it down
45_bj,5,6.0,0.0,I love the surprise in every bite! Caramel and chocolate are a marriage made in heaven!! The caramel ribbons and the caramel covered chocolate bites are sinful! This is by far my all time favorite ice cream!! I drive past 5 grocery stores that carry other Ben & Jerrys Ice Cream just to go purchase this particular flavor!
45_bj,5,8.0,1.0,"I bought this the other night thinking there were no good flavors, and let me tell you. BEST decision of my life. I will NEVER go back. Thank you to the wonder minds who created this flavor and the hard working people who made and packaged my pint. Last but not least the kind soul who was generous enough to deliver my pint to the store I bought i from."
45_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"This hands down is the most delicious caramel ice cream. The caramel ice cream, caramel cups & the caramel swirl are perfection. Amazing"
45_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"If you love caramel, there will NEVER be another ice cream flavor for you!!! What can I say besides its amazing, I love it and can never get enough of it..."
45_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Oh boy, this flavor is the trifecta. I love it so much its going to be the end of a waistline. Thank you B&Js!!!"
45_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"So I just polished off my first Triple Caramel Chunk and I’m very happily stuffed! The caramel ice cream, the swirl and the chocolate fudge chunks; all awesome and perfectly balanced. There is just something so enticing about pulling off the lid of a B&J pint to reveal that glassy smooth ice cream underneath, just begging to be spooned."
45_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is just plain ol’ fashioned good! I love it! The caramel ice cream: great. The caramel swirl: delicious. The caramel-filled truffles: silly yummy! If you need lots of caramel flavor with several different textures (and some nice chocolate, too) as I often do, then this is the ice cream for you! It’ll put a nice big smile right on that mug of yours, and when was the last time you turned down a little extra happiness?"
46_bj,5,17.0,0.0,"I recently found this at my local grocer and was a little skeptical since I like bourbon (Im from KY so by law I have to) but Im not a big fan of caramel. I decided to give it a try but still bought my go-to flavor, Chunky Monkey, just in case this bourbon and caramel infused ice cream wasnt my cup of tea. Despite my reservations I instantly fell in love with this ice cream and now keep a pint stocked in my freezer at all times. the caramel bourbon flavor is smooth, not to rich, and the almonds pieces pair well with the flavor and chunks of chocolate. Well done Ben & Jerry. I reall hope this flavor stays in the lineup for a long while."
46_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"It is SO good! Ive been trying out new flavors instead of my stand by of chunky monkey or mint chocolate cookie. I have liked most and loved 3. But this one knocks my number one out! im not usually a Carmel fan especially the gooey kind (i usually go fudge) but wow! The only thing that I would have done differently is the nuts, i think pecans would have been in keeping with the southern theme ihis has going. But yes, I know, there is aways the pecan pie, which was just a like in my book."
46_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"On a particularly lonely Sunday while I was shopping I decided to grab my normal flavor ""Everything But The..."" to give myself a little treat. Then I saw this flavor staring at me. Carmel, Almonds, and Bourbon oh my! SOLD! I hurried thru dinner so I could rip open the container to get my first spoonful. Its creamy burnt carmel taste hit me first and I couldnt stop. The almonds and chocolate made for great trio of flavor but then it happened... I hit the bourbon carmel center. Oh my goodness my mouth waters just thinking of it. I promptly took a pic and sent it to several friends telling them to find some for themselves right away. Thank you B&J for yet another addiction."
46_bj,5,7.0,0.0,Yet another amazing flavor to come out of the Ben & Jerrys flavor laboratory. I had to hide it from the wife so she wouldnt eat mine.
46_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This flavor is simply not your ordinary ice cream. I enjoy a good helping of Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core now and then, but sometimes I just dont feel like something super sweet and chocolate-y. This flavor has a little bit of everything. Chunks: check. Sweetness: check. Saltiness: check. Rich, dark undertones of something mysterious: check. I love the balance of the darker, rich flavors with the salty, sweet flavors. This is the BEST! All I can say is, they better not ever get rid of it! Its addicting!"
46_bj,5,6.0,1.0,"I was a little worried about buying a new flavor because I have bought a few lately that I havent liked and I didnt want to be let down again. But my favorite flavor is no longer available so I took a risk on this one and boy am I glad. I cant put my spoon down! The almonds, fudge flakes and caramel swirl dance in your mouth and while sometimes you get a bit of the bourbon taste it is not overpowering! Great work guys!!"
46_bj,5,5.0,1.0,So happy my husband got this for me to try! He knows I love bourbon. I really love this flavor! I think u did it just right! Dont think I will share this pint. Maybe the next one. Which there will b plenty of because this is hands down my new favorite!!!! I am not a huge fan of caramel either so I was a little skeptical. But this is the perfect blend of the caramel and the almonds and the chocolate and the bourbon flavor all together. Yummmmmmmmm Nice job <3
46_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I bought this yesterday thinking I would try a new flavor for Sunday dessert. I returned it today minus the spoon or two letting me know this is not a flavor for me. The first spoon was so overrun with almond bits that I could not get a good taste of the ice cream. The second spoon did not prove any better. Needless to say I did not make it to the swirl before deciding it had to be returned. This was the first time I shook my head in wonder at a B&J product (wondering who came up with this; how did it make it to market as a B&J product).
46_bj,3,2.0,0.0,"I think Ben and Jerry ice cream is a superior ice cream to most. When I saw urban bourbon I was really excited to combine 2 of my favorite things. I tried 2 pints, and neither had much of a bourbon flavor to them. The little bits of bourbon that I did get were very good, would have been nice to have more of it I would have hoped for the price of a pint, the flavor would have better matched the name, feel a little taken."
46_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I instantly got addicted to this new flavor. Ive been sad about Dublin Mudslide going to the graveyard for years, but I may have just found something at least equally good. Yes, its sweet (caramel swirls), but not as sweet as any of the core pints or Phish food that I do not like at all. Urban Bourbon is such a delicious combination of flavors! With the crunchy almonds, and chocolat bits it is really perfect to me. Chillin the Roast and New York Super Fudge (one of my go-tos) seemed bland after Urban Bourbon."
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"The ice cream is what counts - all the extras thrown in arent going to compensate for ice cream with no flavor. This ice cream has a complex, full bodied, intense caramel/bourbon taste and is loaded with flavor notes. The thick dark chocolate flakes and almond bits accent the flavor. This was excellent - so much better than the grainy flavorless taste of the coconuts for caramel flavor. I love it."
46_bj,1,2.0,0.0,The flavor sounds great in theory but it seems like its a challenge to make consistent flavoring and distribution of ingredients. My point contained too much of a large center swirl of bourbon that was overly sweet and had me gagging. I couldnt even enjoy the perimeter and ended up tossing the entire pint before guzzling almost a liter of water! Definitely has kinks that need to be worked out.
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I havent eaten ice cream in months-trying to get into a health kick-but I saw this and didnt think twice before grabbing it up to by it guilt free. I am obsessed with bourbon-one of the only liquors worth drinking-so seeing an ice cream with it made my day. If you make it into a milkshake you get more of the bourbon flavor even distributed! Totally need to buy more!

Well I can say that I am glad I remained loyal because this is my new favorite icecream. This could definitely be the difference for me :)"
46_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"despite the name there is no ""alcoholy"" flavors. the base ice cream is delicate, the fudge chunks are rich in flavor as always, I wish there was a bit more almonds in it though as you dont get nuts in every bite and I LOVE almonds but the creamy caramel swirl smoothed me over. delicious!"
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I purchased this a few days ago and now Im hooked! This is my FAVORITE ice cream! I used to go to Brusters a lot to buy ice cream but this one puts everything they have to shame! Thanks so much for this wonderful new flavor and I hope you keep this one on the market!!! :)
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I am loving the new flavors. By far this ia my favorite. im not big on chocolate in my ice cream so i was skeptical on this flavor. To my surprise its perfect! Tiny little flakes and perfect amount of almonds. The bourbon taste is spot on not to overwhelming but noticable.
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Just found this in the freezer at my in-laws and I gave it a try. Usually caramel is so sweet in ice cream but this was unlike anything Ive had before. The balance of flavor was perfect. The chocolate flakes and almonds were plentiful in every bite. Highly recommended!
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"This stuff is amazingly good. And addictive. I chose this new flavor on a whim, not to my boyfriends liking. He is now addicted. I agree, its probably a new favorite. But he cant stop eating it... Great blend of flavors. Whoever came up with this needs an award."
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I dont understand some of the not so great reviews...Im not even a fan of ice cream without a lot of chocolate in it...but this...wow...What an awesome difference from something totally chocolate. Go for it. Cant miss with this. YUM.
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I tried this flavor when it arrived on the shelves at my grocery store. I am HOOKED!! The amount of almonds and chocolate chunks pairs exactly with the burnt caramel and bourbon. I cant imagine a more perfect icecream!!!!
46_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"Cant get enough! Love it. The burnt caramel base flavor is awesome, almonds and fudge the perfect mix ins, but the whiskey flavor is the straw that stirs the drink. Awesome"

46_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I had this one once and didn’t like it, but I wanted to give it another chance and bought it again, and I’m glad I did. It’s really actually quite good when it gets a little melty. The ice cream flavor itself is somewhat subtle and the fudge chunks are really great. The bourbon caramel swirl is delicious! I will definitely buy this flavor again."
46_bj,5,3.0,1.0,Just ate this for breakfast. Great way to start the day. Not being sarcastic
46_bj,5,2.0,1.0,LOVE this flavor. Ben & Jerrys knocked it out of the ballpark. I picked this up at the grocery store because its new and I like caramel. When I got home I attempted to take a taste of it and ended up eating half the pint! I love the unique bourbon and caramel flavors and the crunch of the chocolate and almonds.
46_bj,1,3.0,2.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I love Bourbon but this ice cream was gross. I got barely a quarter of a pint done and had to throw it out. Luckily I went out the next night and found gen and jerrys One Love and that made up for it."
46_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I bought this for my husband who loves anything bourbon flavored. He couldnt wait to try it and was very disappointed. He said it had no flavor at all that he could tell, it was just overly sweet. There was certainly no flavor of bourbon."
46_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I just bought this tonight and am happily surprised. I have been going from flavor to flavor and brand to brand looking for just the right chunky and carmelly combo. And the bourbon is the cherry on top! Thank you for making the best out there.
46_bj,3,2.0,1.0,"Its fine, but it didnt wow me. The flavors are all just too muted, for some reason. But, it was 90 degrees in the city today, so Im not too unhappy about it. Im just glad I have ice cream to cool me down."
46_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"This has everything I look for in an ice cream, but more! Ive never had this flavor of ice cream. My only complaint is, I actually think it has too many almonds! But thats better than having too few!"
46_bj,3,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is ok. I think if it was made with salted caramel and a few less almonds it would be great. The bourbon swirls are tasty. I was a little disappointed in this flavor.
46_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This one is a keeper, so good. The bourbon and the caramel go together so well. Almonds come through too. Chocolate chunks should be smaller."

47_bj,5,12.0,3.0,Best Vanilla Ice cream ever! And I have tried quite a number of them
47_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"I mean it, folks! This is by far the best Vanilla ice cream available. It doesn’t get better. It’s creamy, dense, sweet, rich and very natural tasting. It’s the essence of Vanilla; very intense. It also has a great mouth feel. Yes, it isn’t full of chunks, swirls and mix-ins but that doesn’t mean it’s boring. On the contrary, each bite is an exploration of what it means to taste true Vanilla. Honestly it’s the best."
47_bj,5,5.0,1.0,"My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla. Simple, sweet, savory, creamy, delicious vanilla. Ive tried dozens of fancy/gourmet brands of vanilla and always come back to Ben & Jerrys. Its got great vanilla flavor and just the right amount of salt to the cream to make this savory and not bland at all."
47_bj,5,10.0,3.0,"The best vanilla ice cream ever! It doesnt need anything added, its great all by itself."
47_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Great Flavor! Vanilla Beans! Nothing else added. Its a great flavor when you want something simple.
48_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"I’m 62 and have loved B&J ice creams since first invented. I’ve probably cut a year or two off my life and don’t mind abit. Why? Because of this particular flavor combination. It’s the bees knees & the cats meow all rolled up into one sweet swirl. Once you try this, your flavor dreams will be fulfilled forever. This is the only B&J flavor combination I’d every want to be stranded on a desert island with, just me and my Vanilla-Caramel-Fudge Swirl! This is the creamiest, fudgiest, carameliest, tastiest, smoothest ice evermade. Dont wait, just go get some and enjoy every last lick!"
48_bj,5,6.0,0.0,I LOVE this flavor. It is flawless with just the right amount of caramel and fudge against the vanilla ice cream. Please never alter or retire this flavor!
48_bj,5,6.0,0.0,"Nothing fancy, but definitely one of my favorites! If you are thinking of trying it youll be glad you did!"
48_bj,5,8.0,1.0,This was my favorite years ago and was discontinued. I found it in my local grocery store and have been happy ever since. No chucks! I just dont like chewing my ice cream. The fudge and carmel is loaded in the ice cream. Pure awesomeness!!
48_bj,5,3.0,0.0,dont ever ever ever! you knocked it out of the park and if you ever get rid of this flavor i will cry endlessly and be depressed until the end of my days. its amazing. so SO amazing.
48_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Whenever I look for Ben and Jerrys, this is what I seek."
48_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Love this flavor but it is not available in my area. According to the web site it should be at. A certain store but the store does not have it
49_bj,3,9.0,0.0,"So I typically buy these a lot! I’m actually kinda obsessed, this is my absolute favorite. Although I’ve noticed lately the cookie “core” isn’t much of a core anymore rather than just a little piece. I’m pretty disappointed as I’ve gone far enough to write a review. I posted a picture to show how small it’s become. This is with me eating around it, by the way."
49_bj,4,5.0,0.0,"Now this is one of the few cores Ive taken a liking to. The consistency of the cookie core is in an interesting one....smooth enough, but not exactly ""cookie-like,"" however, this does not mean it is not good. This ice cream can become quite a bit as you move towards the bottom of the pint, but I think if youre a seasoned ice cream veteran you could power through to the end. I do however wish there was a bit more vanilla to counteract the cookie core and mocha flavors, but this isnt exactly a complaint; perhaps my pint had a somewhat skewed ratio of vanilla:cookie:mocha."
49_bj,5,19.0,2.0,THIS ICE CREAM IS THE BEST YET OUT OF THE B@JS SMOOTH DECEDANT COOKIE CORE COLLECTION! I TRIED THE BROWNIE BATTER BUT THERE WASNT ENOUGH BATTER TO PLEASE! BUT THIS ONE HAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING IN IT AND THE CORE IS A BUTTERY CHOCOLATY COOKIE BONANZA!! TRY IT AND U WONT STOP! IVE EATEN A PINT EVERY NIGHT FOR TWO WEEKS! BE CAREFUL YOULL GET HOT AND HUNGARY FOR THIS ONE AND IF U HAVE TO YOULL PAWN A DIAMOND RING FOR THIS ADDICTION! HEHE! ANDRE
49_bj,5,14.0,1.0,"This is my all time favorite flavor from B&J, and after an exceptionally grating day, I went to my local grocer to find this pint, only to find (for the third visit this month) that it wasnt there... Defeated, I searched the flavor and came across the locator page on the website and found not one, but ten different places nearby had it! Tears were shed, angels sang, the day was quite literally saved by Ben and Jerry, and their Boom Chocolata flavor. Thanks so much"
49_bj,3,5.0,2.0,"I love both sides of the ice cream! Both absolutely delicious! The mocha is to die for and the chocolate cookie and fudge flakes make for great textural and flavor components. That’s the first ‘50’ in the title of my review. The second ‘50’ is the core. While it was thick and went all the way to the bottom, the flavor is just frankly very unpleasant in my opinion. The texture of the core is also strange; gritty, grainy, hard and pasty. If this were a standard pint, not a Core, it would be a total knockout 100% awesome pint which I would buy regularly. As it is though, I think I’m done."
49_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I just tried this for the first time and I am absolutely hooked! I could live without the fudge chips, but the rest of the concoction is above reproach. The caramel side is delicate & flavorful all on its own, the mocha side is a fantastic coffee kick with subtle notes of rich chocolate. The chocolate cookie core is very true to delicious cookie consistency, I did not find any issue with the texture or taste, and Im very sensitive. This may well be my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor ever. Ill weep hysterically in the streets if it is discontinued. 11/10 stars"
49_bj,5,17.0,0.0,My all-time fave!!! Please dont ever discontinue!

Then I kept eating, and the cookie core never ended. It was the the best ice-cream-eating experience Ive ever had. Thank you for this flavor Ben & Jerrys. Thank you for your ice cream."
49_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I just recently found this ice cream and I absolutely love it but I cant find it anymore in stores. Please tell me its not going away?
49_bj,5,4.0,0.0,Didnt know what to expect when I bought this about a month ago but know I crave it all the time. Best flavor so far
49_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I buy this two or three times a week. I absolutely love it! I’m concerned though. The local drug store quit carrying it a few months ago and now my local grocery store has a “close out” sign on the display. PLEASE don’t tell me this flavor is being discontinued! I don’t want to live in a world without Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core!
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor. I will choose it over every other flavor time and time again. I cannot imagine ever getting bored of this ice cream. It has the perfect ratio of chocolate to coffee and the core!!!!!! Oh, the core... it is exquisite. I can eat this by the bucket loads. Ben and Jerrys won me over with this flavor. They have other good ones too but they pale in comparison to my beloved Boom Chocolatta!"
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is hands down my favorite flavor! I go through phases every few years where I am extremely loyal to one flavor and will refuse to venture out. Eventually a flavor comes out that might sound like it could be good and I’ll give it a shot. Oh this was SO worth it. I am currently going through minimum a pint a week! AHH!
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I feel so bad for all the other flavours because I cant go past this amazing combo. The cookie core is hard but crumbly when applied with enough pressure and the texture is kind of gritty - its fantastic! i try hard not to eat it all in one go but I cant stop the cookie train once its started.
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,The Exquisite taste as well as texture all goes so smoothly with each other that it makes the perfect combination of an extreme delightful explosion of taste in your mouth. It almost has a hint of like a coffee type of flavoring but not to a broad of a taste its just exquisite.
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Have you guys stopped making these? I cant find these any stores here in Cary, NC. I love this ice cream and this is the only icecream I have been eating for that past 5 years. Please dont stop making it. The cookie core is the best of the best part. From your most loyal fan."
49_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I never thought I wouldnt like one of B&J ice creams, but this one might be the one. The cookie core has a sandy texture and a weird flavour I cannot describe. It doesne even taste like cookies. The ice creams themselves (minus the cookie core) are great."
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,i cant explain how happy i am that you guys have created this magnificent flavor. the burst of chocolate chunks and mocha flavor and the oh so wonderful cookie core. theres nothing more perfect that id rather put in my mouth
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"By far the best flavor you guys have ever produced but I havent been able to find it in Australia for a while now. Why did you guys discontinue it?? :( Is there any way at all I can get more, I am desperate here!!! </3"
49_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Flavor is on point. When ""Boom Chocolatta"" first came out the core was huge and went straight to the bottom, now its like a narrow funnel. Starts small and gets smaller with every bite. Bring back the full cores!"
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"As someone who loves coffee and chocolate, this ice cream rocked my world. The cookie core is addicting and the subtle gentleness of the caramel ice cream marries every element of this flavor perfectly."
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Had to special order a case . This is by far my all time favorite ice cream !!! Everything about it is just amazing ! Please never discontinue . I drove all over Florida looking for this flavor
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Seriously this has been a favorite for a long time. Lots of flavors and textures and the cookie core is AMAZING LIKE BLENDED OREOS BUT BETTER. Really fantastic ice cream, that never gets old."
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my all time favorite, anytime I see it I have to buy! I personally LOVE the cookie core, it’s so smooth. Always recommend this flavor in particular to friends because I’m obsessed."
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I could eat this flavor everyday forever! It has just the right flavor combination and the cookie core is by far the best core out of them all. The texture is just right! Yum!
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this core flavor! The center tastes just like ground up oreos, and it compliments the mocha and caramel ice creams very well. Highly recommended!"
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My husband or kid? Leaves me the ice cream while my favorite textured cookie core is no where to be found! More CORE pleeeeease!!!
49_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Just like another reviewer said, its mud pie in a pint. Officially hands down my favorite ice cream ever"
50_bj,1,37.0,2.0,"I love Ben & Jerry’s which is why I am writing this review - I feel they would care to know how disappointing this flavor is! The core in the pint I purchased was super small, making it a total disappointment. I kept digging hoping it would get bigger and it just ended up almost disappearing. The ice cream as always was delicious, but I felt I would’ve been more satisfied with my old favorite standby, half baked."
50_bj,2,44.0,2.0,i am so upset that this didnt meet any of my expectations. the cookie “dough” is just grainy sugar! not to mention i get more cookie dough out of a regular ben & jerry’s cookie dough or even half baked than what i got in this. this needs a reboot! please consider making the core out of your oringinal cookie dough recipe!
50_bj,1,20.0,1.0,I was so excited for this because I love cookie dough but there’s never enough. I thought the core would look how it’s advertised. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Barely any dough. Didn’t go all the way through consistently and couldn’t even be in the center. Also the dough didn’t taste great? Idk why but I like the vanilla better. Should have read the reviews first it was such a let down and I feel like I wasted my money.
50_bj,1,47.0,3.0,"Even after reading all the reviews that said it wasnt good I still went and bought it anyways because it looked & sounded so good, but sadly the reviews are right. most of the time with cookie dough ice cream I wish there was more cookie dough (i thought this would be the super cookie-doughy flavor i always dreamed of.. theres not even that much in it), but with this pint i actually prefer the part around the core that doesnt have any. ben & jerry if u see this please re-make this flavor with better quality cookie dough, it had so much potential"
50_bj,1,43.0,1.0,"I preordered this as soon as they announced that it was available in the online store. I was so excited to dig in but while the ice cream is delicious, the cookie dough core is terrible. Rock hard, gritty, sandy, and very inconsistent in size from the top of the pint to the bottom. I hate having to write this review, especially because the other 2 new cookie cores were pretty good, but this one is REALLY dreadful! I’m really bummed because I wanted badly to love it."
50_bj,1,46.0,1.0,"I waited and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. Hard, grainy cookie dough core? This is nothing like cookie dough. Don’t be fooled, the cookie dough core is SMALL! I’m a Ben and Jerry’s fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed!"
50_bj,1,49.0,2.0,"Such a let down from Ben and Jerry’s. The cookie dough core was hard, dry, and basically tasted like granulated sugar. I am so underwhelmed by all the cores but this one was by far the most disappointing. Stick to the regular pints: my opinion best flavor is Gimme S’more."
50_bj,1,50.0,4.0,Bought this last night and was incredibly disappointed. Never write reviews but don’t buy this. The cookie dough was literally like sweet sand. It was gritty and grainy. Threw us away after about 5 bites. I’ll stick to the original Cookie Dough.
50_bj,1,18.0,0.0,"I bought this, excited to try it as cookie dough is my favorite. Well the core was rock solid. It had to be eaten in 1 huge chunk instead of mixing with the ice cream. Very disappointed!"
50_bj,2,16.0,1.0,I just bought this with very high expectations because the regular Cookie Dough flavor is amazing. The cookie dough core tastes like pure brown sugar. I would definitely not buy this again unless they made it taste like the original cookie dough flavor.
50_bj,1,5.0,0.0,"The idea sounded so amazing, so I did not think it could possibly be as bad as the reviews said it was...Well I was wrong, it is actually worse. The ice cream itself is fine, but the core tastes like just brown sugar crystals. Not even remotely the same flavor or texture as their normal cookie dough. Did someone actually taste this before signing off on it? This is a total miss and anyone who was fooled into buying it should be provided a refund."
50_bj,1,3.0,0.0,This is not the same flavor as the well known Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I bought this at target because they didn’t have the original cookie dough I liked. It’s not good y’all. The dough seems like a new recipe. It’s got an odd texture, like sugar grains didn’t mix well and the chocolate chips are weird. The worst part is there’s not enough weird dough compared to the vanilla ice cream. I hope the old cookie dough hasn’t been replaced with this!"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was really excited to see this in my grocer’s freezer. Having had karamel sutra core with its strong ratio of caramel to ice cream, I thought it would be great to get a nice glob of cookie dough going down the center of the pint. Instead, I was left incredibly disappointed with hardly any cookie dough in the entire container. Even worse, the dough included seemed to be dry and crumbly compared to what I’m used to in regular cookie dough. Very disappointing, I won’t be buying this one again unless they improve the formulation and increase the cookie dough. Worst b&j pint I’ve ever purchased."
50_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"The regular chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite and has been for YEARS, its soooo BOMB!! This iteration of it is absolutely disgusting the cookie core is not dough its literally just sugar, and it doesnt even go throughout the entire pint, not even half, not even in the center , its the grossest thing .Some of the other cores are really good which is why i gave this one a try but how could you get chocolate chip cookie dough wrong . I dont normally write reviews but I felt like i HAD to warn someone."
50_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"When I first heard this flavor was coming out I was so excited. I waited 4 weeks to get my hands on one of these and finally found one yesterday at Wawa. I read the reviews before purchasing this, but decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everyone was right. The cookie dough has a sandy texture and crumbles to pieces and it doesnt taste very good either. Plus the core didnt even go all the way to the bottom of the container...definately wasnt worth the $5.99 I paid for it. :("
50_bj,1,6.0,0.0,Wow I love ben and jerrys but this one is sad. I debated between this one and another core one but chose this one due to my love of cookie dough. Well I wish I read the reviews first because they were incredibly right. Grainy cookie dough and the core in mine didnt even go half way down!!!
50_bj,2,2.0,1.0,"At first I thought my taste buds were off, but no...the dough really just tastes (and feels like) brown sugar. Also, the bottom part of my pint had an air bubble, so it was hollow. Overall very disappointing. Ill just stick to the B&Js regular cookie dough ice cream!"
50_bj,1,5.0,0.0,I was soooooo excited to try this!! Then I did and immediately wished I got something else. The ice cream was good but the supposed cookie dough core was like eating brown sugar and chocolate chips. It was so nasty that I ate around it. Truly disappointed....I have never been let down before so I guess there is a first time for everything.
50_bj,1,5.0,0.0,I have been waiting for this to come out at my grocery store. The minute I could buy it I got it. I was really upset. Like many others have said the cookie dough core is sandy and grainy. I was thinking it was going to be like the cookie dough in the normal ice cream. Really upset about this.
50_bj,1,2.0,0.0,I am a loyal fan and this is the one and only flavor I have thrown away. The pictures make it look amazing and I understand it’s for marketing so variation is expected. That being said the “core” is almost non existent. The bottom half of the ice cream had absolutely no core. The top half had a small chunk. The cookie dough that I did get was grainy and had a funky taste. It wasn’t cookie dough that’s for sure. The ice cream itself was creamy and had a nice flavor but I’m so disappointed that this was such a flop.
50_bj,1,6.0,0.0,Not at all like non core cookie dough which is soft and tastes really good. The core tastes terrible and has a very hard grainy texture. Not good!
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"This is the first time I havent been able to finish a pint of Ben & Jerrys. Tried it and threw the rest away! I love cookie dough ice cream and thought this would be great, only to be extremely disappointed! The vanilla ice cream is almost tasteless, and the cookie dough ""core"" was absolutely gross. It had none of the flavors I would expect from cookie dough, basically just sugar with a few chocolate chips. Plus, the core was half the size of the other flavors! This flavor is a HUGE miss, save yourself the trouble and try the sugar cookie core flavor instead!"
50_bj,5,22.0,15.0,My order of these new pints was delivered yesterday from the Ben and Jerry’s online store and last night was Chocolate Chip Cookie dough core. it’s awesome! The ice cream really does taste like cookie milk. I’ve never had anything like it; so yummy. but the star is the core. PERFECT texture and EXCELLENT flavor. The ice cream and the core together are a match made in heaven. It’s sublime. I hope this stays for a long time.
50_bj,1,7.0,1.0,"I wait and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. HARD, grainy, gritty cookie dough core. This is nothing like cookie dough. Dont be fooled the cookie dough center is SMALL. Im a Ben & Jerrys fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed in my purchase."
50_bj,1,3.0,0.0,"I literally stalked the grocery stores for this to come out and was so excited to snag it. Super disappointed. I’m a huge fan of B&J and cookie dough ice cream but this was terrible. Agree with other reviewers, the cookie dough was grainy and gritty. I didn’t want to throw it out so I kept eating it, but it took me well over 2 weeks to finish a pint. For context, I’m lucky if a pint lasts three days."
50_bj,1,4.0,0.0,I bout the NEW COOKIE DOUGH CORE. Was not good at all when I think of cookie dough it’s soft creamy just like normal cookie dough. It’s like eating sand very big disappointment honestly and I ben&jerrys. Work on this please!
50_bj,2,6.0,2.0,"I bought the Cookie Dough Core ice cream because I usually love chocolate chip cookie dough. While the ice cream itself was delicious ( the only reason I didnt give this 1 star), I was completely disappointed by the cookie dough core part. It was gritty and just not good. I ended up eating around it and dont even want to bother with the rest of the pint. No good!"
50_bj,3,3.0,1.0,"I gave this product a 3 just because I like cookie dough. I felt like this was no different than the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I would have liked to see more cookie dough, like maybe a chocolate chip cookie dough with a cookie dough core, maybe a half chocolate half vanilla.. I think then that would have made more sense. All the other core pint flavors are more special and different this one was boring and basic... not my favorite unfortunately."
50_bj,2,69.0,65.0,"I bought the cookie dough core and the cookie dough was crumbly when I tried to scoop it out. It was hard, had a grainy texture and didnt taste very good at all,nothing like the cookie dough in the half baked. The icecream part was good though"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,Totally disappointed in this flavor. I love Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough. But the cookie dough core was terrible. First of all the core was more like a cone getting smaller the more you dug down and it didn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the pint. And the cookie dough itself was terrible it was grainy and didn’t have the same taste the cookies dough usually has. It tasted like it was heavy on brown sugar or something. It just wasn’t right. Anyway I was sorely disappointed.
50_bj,1,2.0,0.0,"Nope, Nope, Nope! You cannot fool a cookie dough expert. I had my heart set on this having a REAL cookie dough core. Much to my dismay, the core was nothing like the cookie dough in your other ice creams. :("
50_bj,1,2.0,0.0,Like most other reviewers i found the core terrible. Bad texture and bad taste.
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I bought this with so much excitement, when I took that first bite into the core, yuck! The cookie dough is just straight sugar, when you chew it your feel the grinds on your teeth. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and that is the cookie dough I expected the core to be filled with and boy was I wrong! Do not purchase this kind, you will just end up throwing it away like I did"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was really disappointed with the cookie dough in the core. It was dry and crumbly, not creamy and doughy like the regular CCCD. It also has an off flavor...like they spilled the vanilla when making this crusty old dough. The ice cream part was decent. I saw somebody else noted a big air bubble at the bottom. Im had the same experience. I do not recommend and will not purchase again."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"My family bought this on accident thinking it was the regular cookie dough recipe. I tried it anyways and it was way too sweet. The cookie milk was not a smart move, there was nothing to offset the sweetness of the cookie dough. Cookie dough with just vanilla is much better in my opinion. Also, the cookie dough was very grainy and mostly tasted like straight up sugar."
50_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The core is very gritty and tastes odd on its own, but tastes good with the ice cream. The sugar in the cookie dough wasn’t beaten long enough to get rid of the graininess and could’ve been so much better. The base is unique and creamy and the chocolate flakes are solid, though I wish there were more of them. Overall, a bit underwhelming with a disappointing core."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I loooove cookie dough ice cream. When I saw the core on the package I was like “heck yes! Extra cookie dough!” Psych! There’s like NONE and it’s impossible to scoop out. Then, the cookie dough itself is disgusting! It tastes like how I imagine literal fish food would. I absolutely hate it and I genuinely think it was a waste of my money."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I’m so sad I wasted $12 on this ice cream, I am in Australia and I was so excited to try this and i am so let down I didn’t even eat it. The cookie dough is grainy and tastes nothing like the cookie dough that’s in the rest of the flavours, and the “fudge” pieces are just dark chocolate. Do not waste your money!"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,One of my favorite flavors is the cookie dough. Expectations were highly disappointed when the same cookie dough recipe was not in this cookie dough core flavor. I’m not even sure it’s cookie dough. I think it’s pure brown sugar. Will not buy this flavor again unless they put the original cookie dough in it!
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Im eating this flavor as we speak and the other reviews are right! Tastes NOTHING like the cookie doigh in the other flavors. It has a sandy, gritty texture like chewing on sugar. Im going to finish it though because the rest of it is alright. But yeah i’ll just stick to my favorite one , Half Baked!!!"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Ive bought this a few different times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. I kept thinking ""okay, I must have had bad luck and gotten a bad batch"". Unfortunately after buying approximately 5 to 6 pints, Ive come to the conclusion that this just isnt good in any way. The ""cookie milk"" ice cream just tastes like regular old vanilla but with a slightly weird taste and extremely weird aftertaste. The ""cookie dough"" core (which, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best part and main attraction) was horrible! Did NOT taste like cookie dough AT ALL! Even the texture was so, soooooo off! Just like all the other reviews say - TASTES LIKE SWEETENED SAND! Now dont get my wrong - I am usually a HUGE fan of B&Js - however this particular flavor just is completely so far off from the quality Ive come to know and love, and expect from this brand. This could have been an amazing and wonderful flavor but unfortunately this missed the mark. Extremely dissappointed, B&Js!! Do better!!"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Was so excited to try this because I love Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I experienced disappointment at the first bite. The Cookie Chip Dough Core was like eating super gritty sugar sand. I am hoping Ben & Jerry will switch and use their original Cookie Dough recipe in this new ""core"" ice cream."
50_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"The first flavor Ive been disappointed with. The ""cookie dough"" core has the texture of brown sugar. When you chew it you can feel the sugar crystals. Its not the same as the cookie dough balls in the regular cookie dough pint. I did still polish off the pint though since the ice cream is good"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The ratio of cookie dough to ice cream is off. By the time you get to the bottom of the pint, all thats left is the vanilla ice cream with little chocolate bits. Youre better off getting chocolate chip cookie dough which is more consistent and has a better cookie dough-to-ice cream ratio."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I just had this ice cream a hour ago, the actually ice is not bad at all but the cookie dough just ruined it for me. It tasted so gritty , I thought maybe I should mix it up and it made it even worse. I ended up scooping as much of the cookie dough out that I could. Smh"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Listen to the bad reviews. the core does not taste like their regular cookie dough. It tastes grainy, like brown sugar. And the rest of it is just chocolate chip ice cream. So nothing exciting. The wake and bake ice cream core was the same. Super grainy."
50_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"The cookie milk ice cream was the only thing I liked about the product. As a cookie dough lover, I was very disappointed in the cookie dough core. It tasted nothing like cookie dough, just grainy like sugar. I’ll stick with other cookie dough varieties."
50_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Im not the hugest fan of cookie dough in ice cream, so Im going to be honest I ate around the cookie dough core and OH MAN the cookie milk flavored ice cream is probably the yummiest ice cream flavor Ive ever had! YUM"
50_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love the cookie milk ice cream. I wish they would use this as the base for more flavors. The chocolate chips are also delicious and I’ve always had plenty of cookie dough in my pints. This flavor is the best!
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"AWFUL. I’m a huge fan of Ben & Jerrys cookie dough and this was such a disappointment. The cookie dough core crumbles and is as hard as a rock. It’s grainy and tastes terrible, too."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I bought this for the cookie dough core and there is no cookie dough core.. this is the second pint of ""core"" Ive cream that didnt even have a core. Im really disappointed."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Ice cream tasted like artificial sweeteners and the core was nothing like cookie dough in taste or texture. Was very disappointed, totally not worth the price (or calories)"
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"The cookie dough core taste terrible, like it has some kind of sweeteners in it. the after taste lingers like sour milk...dont buy this!"
50_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The ice cream is nice but could use something besides just chips. The core is grainy and sugary totally unlike the regular cookie dough.
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I was looking forward to trying this, but it was a let down. The ice cream was decent, but the cookie dough core was grainy and sad."
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,This is terrible! The cookie dough core is basically brown sugar with chocolate. I wish I could get my money back.
50_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I love every ice cream they put out. I particularly love this flavor and I recommend it to everyone.
50_bj,1,1.0,0.0,I’m pretty sure there is less cookie dough in throw then there is in the regular one
51_bj,5,27.0,2.0,"Ummm this is the best thing Ive ever eaten (probably). Ive been silently waiting for cookie dough core Ben & Jerrys and this one outdid any expectations I had. All of the flavors (almond, cherry, sugar cookie, shortbread) taste like happiness on a pink cloud of soft fatty calorie heaven. Would definitely eat an entire pint in one sitting to cope with my depressed emotions again. Hoping to also eat part of a pint in one sitting while Im happy to experience the flavors in a different mood so I will update when that happens. (Spoiler alert: still going to be 5 star rating.)"
51_bj,5,16.0,0.0,"This is great! The cherry/cherry reminds me of Cherry Garcia and the sweet cream almond is really pleasant. I was afraid the almond would be too far forward but it’s actually very well balanced. But of course, as always, the core is the star of this pint. I had to resist the urge to pry out the entire core and eat it all at once. It’s really delicious! Mine was pretty firm but it had just come out of the deep freeze so that’s understandable. I can’t wait to buy another of these. Now onto my last one; the wake no-bake."
51_bj,5,11.0,1.0,"I have been sampling my way through the cores, and this one has absolutely been my favorite. Though I like the core itself, for me its the ice creams and chunks that make it. I do love almond flavor, and this is done perfectly. At first glance, I thought that cookie dough/cherries/cherry ice cream/shortbread/sweet cream almond ice cream was going to be too over-the-top, but everything comes together perfectly. Theres not a flavor or texture Id leave out. We have a winner!"
51_bj,5,34.0,2.0,I have purchased almost 10 pints of this since discovering it. Literally the best ice cream I have ever had! Never stop making it!
51_bj,5,11.0,1.0,I was intitially hesistant about this because I’m not a huge cherry fan. I do however love sugar cookies (and especially the dough). When I finally found it in a store I wasn’t sure what to expect but it was seriously amazing! I love the almond-y flavor it has to it and it actually works quite well with the cherry. Will definitely be repurchasing once this pint is gone!
51_bj,5,11.0,0.0,"This ice cream tastes like Tortoni, one of my favorite desserts, only it’s amped up to 11. I hope they never stop making this."
51_bj,5,9.0,0.0,Always hesitant about branching out and trying a new flavor but I think I just found my new favorite...absolutely amazing
51_bj,5,8.0,2.0,"Bought it on a whim, and now I find myself craving this new amazing flavor!! The almond, and cherry goes so perfect together.. and the sugar cookie actually tastes like the real thing! You won’t be disappointed. I hope they keep this one around for a while."
51_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I’ve eaten a lot of ice cream over my nearly six decades of life, and have been a Cherry Garcia fanatic for years. I never dreamed that Ben and Jerry’s would create a better flavor. I am happy to say I was wrong. Sweet Like Sugar beats out Cherry Garcia by a nose."
51_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"Please dont EVER stop making this! The combo of flavors and textures is perfect: the touch of almond in the sweet cream on the one side and the nostalgic Cherry Garcia on the other, all tied together by the most decadent sugar cookie dough core... seriously. It cant be beat. It tastes like a bunch of classic holiday flavors combined!"
51_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Wow. I bought this as I quickly saw something new on my way out the store and I’m glad I did. I’m not a huge chocolate fan so it’s so nice to get a non chocolate flavor!! Both “sides” are great. The cherry side is similar to a non chocolate cherry Garcia and the sweet cream side is a delightful lightly almond flavor. Love this flavor.
51_bj,5,3.0,0.0,This is the kind of ice cream they eat in heaven. Jumping to the top of my favorite flavor list.
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I bought this about a year ago, leading up to that I had been looking for it tirelessly. Once I finally got my hands on it.... it did not disappoint! This is the most delicious ice cream ever, the almond flavor is spot on and the cherry side is loaded with luscious, large cherries. The sugar cookie dough core is wow, just wow. I love the texture of grainy sugar in a sugar cookie and this hit it right on the nail. I will definitely be repurchasing this item till the end of time!"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I’m usually not motivated to leave feedback, but after tasting this ice cream, I just had to post. It is amazing! Very seldom do you taste an ice cream that is so subtly crafted, so much thought went into this one. Each of the defining characteristics plays well with each other (the cherries, the shortbread, the almond flavor, the sugar cookie), though none is overpowering. You keep going back from one flavor to another, then appreciating each even more upon return. A sense of deep creaminess and vanilla tie everything together. Great texture. If there were a comparison to be made to a layered and multi-dimensional chocolatey dessert, this would be the decadent vanilla counterpart. So satisfying, you’ll be scooping up any available pints at your local grocer before someone else finds it... I know I have. Bravo."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Please please please keep this flavor! I tried it as a shake at my local Ben and Jerrys shop and it has to be the best shake I have ever had. The flavors are subtle and delicious and make you want more! I would buy this flavor everytime, all the parts work so well together and are so balanced! My new favorite flavor for sure!!! I love the almond and cookie flavors and the cherry is just a sweet hint and not too overpowering. Seriously, please keep this flavor around!"
51_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I had this at the scoop shop Friday then went on a mission to find the pints! Please don’t ever stop making this one! It is so good with the cookie dough and cherries. Perfectly balanced and just the right amount of sweetness!!
51_bj,5,2.0,0.0,This is the best ice cream. Ever. Please dont ever kill this off and put in the graveyard!
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive been waiting yearssssss for something that would resemble ""Mission to Marzipan"" which was discontinued around 2010 or so and I finally found it!! Im in love, I stumbled upon Sweet like sugar Abt a month ago and have probably eaten 5 cartons since!PLEASE NEVER EVER GET RID OF IT, BEGGING YOU!! The cookie dough, the almond flavor, the cherries!!! PERFECTION"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I am a huge cherry ice cream lover but hate the chocolate chips that are normally put in it so when this ice cream creation came out I was in LOVE!!! The sugar cookie core is amazing. I usually will buy 4-6 pints when I go to store just to make sure I never run out. Thanks Ben and Jerry for a great new ice cream for us non-chocolate lovers!
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"i don’t like chocolate in ice cream so I’m always trying to find a good flavor without fudge or chocolate. I usually get vanilla or pistachio but this combination sounded good. It was so good, I finished eating the entire pint in a couple of days. In fact, I think this is one of the best tasting ice cream flavor ever!"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,It is like this was made just for me. It is all of my favorite flavors combined in one. The almond flavor is a good balance. It isnt too strong or overpowering. The cookies and swirl are different enough to bring their own element. I love this creation. Please dont ever let this one go. My newest addiction!
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My brother loves shortbread cookies and cherry ice cream so I thought I’d get him this as a going away present before he left for summer camp. Me and my mom ended up eating almost all of it... oops sorry bro :/ but honestly it was THAT good! This is definitely one of my new favorite flavors!
51_bj,5,5.0,4.0,"I loved it, I just didn’t eat the cherry ice cream because I’m not a big fan of it due to my allergy"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is by far my favorite ice cream! I love the almond and cherry flavors mixed with the crunch of the sugar in the dough. The best part: NO Chocolate! Unfortunately, it is impossible to find since March :( I’m worried it will disappear like “Cool Britannia...”"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Please, please don’t ever send this flavor to the graveyard. It is hands down the best flavor I have ever had. There is half a pint sitting in my freezer right now and I will divorce my husband if he thinks he can finish that off... that’s how good it is."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I am not one to write reviews and I am typically not one to like elaborate mash-ups but they outdid themselves with this flavor. If I could drop one ingredient, Id cut out the cherry chunks but this is so well done we are just nit picking. A must try."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This is the BEST B&J ice cream I have ever tasted. Almond sweet cream ice cream tastes so much like the Italian 7 layer bar cookies. That hint of Almond is to die for. And the cookie dough core...dont get me started. Drooling....!!
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I am not a fan of cherry ice cream, however I love almond flavored desserts and cookie dough. The cherry was not fake tasting or overpowering and the almond ice cream and cookie core was amazing. Definitely a good choice!"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I recently tried each of the newest core flavors and this one takes the cake. It’s bursting with flavor, the core is delicious, everything about it is A+. Definitely one of the best flavors in my opinion!"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"It literally taste just like its name!! Very yummy well paired ingredients It has dark sweet cherries, chewy and sweet shortbread and a sugary cookie core throughout Well done B&J"
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is hands-down my new favorite B&J flavor and I hope it never goes away. It is very smooth, with nothing over-powering, and the cherries are a nice touch."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"You’ve turned an ice cream hater into an ice cream lover. Thank you, B&J! PS) I added some walnuts to mine."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So delicious!! My new go to flavor!! Please keep this one around!! It is a keeper lol so good mmm mmm mmm
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,A sugar cookie dough core?! Almond and cherry?! One of the best flavors ever. Dont ever get rid of it.
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"This is a sweet, super-delicious almond-y sugar cookie flavor. One of my favorites of recent years."
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite flavor ever! I do wish the almond flavor was a little more prominent though.
51_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Catch me at the grocery store buying out the whole stock this flavor is SO good!
52_bj,5,24.0,1.0,"Open your freezer. Do you see ice cream that isnt Wake & No Bake Cookie Dough Core? Thats your first mistake. Get in your car, on your bike, or in your hovercar and go to the closest store for this. Dont believe its THAT good? Thats your second mistake."
52_bj,5,4.0,0.0,"When I saw this I was so excited because I’ve been making no bake cookies with my grandma years! ( hers are the best I’ve ever had ;) ) aside from that I personally like to add a little more peanut butter to the cookie mixture which would’ve been nice in this cookie core. The peanut butter cookies didn’t taste like peanut butter to me. The vanilla ice cream was fine, just subtle enough to let everything else shine. The best way to eat no bakes is while they’re still warm and not set up with a big glass of milk. I thought no bakes were an Oklahoma thing so I’m happy to see them represented in a product that’s sold worldwide."
52_bj,5,6.0,2.0,"I bought this thinking the name was just kinda funny(love you guys for it!) But I was sceptical due to not being a big fan of your core series of ice creams. I had always found the core to be over powering, not allowing the rest of the ice cream to really shine, but this was totally different! This one some how is lighter, not to over bearing, and yet still brings the spoonful of chocolate to the table. Maybe its the oats, maybe its the amount of cocoa in the mix, who knows. But yall nailed it on the head this time! Really hope this stays, happy to have found something else chocolaty from you guys other then my usual Tonight Dough."
52_bj,5,8.0,1.0,"I went from psyched when I first saw these were out, to wary when Id heard several pans of this flavor, to delighted when I decided to try it anyway (and wondering why I ever doubted myself)! I thought the base flavors were a little muted, yes, but the core and mix-ins were great--not too gargantuan fudge chips, soft and chewy cookies (not dry like some have experienced), and a really unique and fun core. Plus, my particular pint was quality-control goals--solid core all the way through the container, not a single air pocket, and plenty of mix-ins distributed from top to bottom too!"
52_bj,3,13.0,4.0,Finallly found this flavor. Vanilla ice cream is good but plain. Peanut butter cookie dough pieces are smaller than I expected and have a bland/dry taste. Chocolate cookie core is mediocre at best. Not as full of topping as expected. I’m disappointed.
52_bj,4,18.0,3.0,"A lot of reviews you can tell these people have no idea what the core is supposed to be. Its not supposed to be like traditional cookie dough. It perfectly emulates the flavor and texture of classic no-bake cookies. A mixture primarily of chocolate, peanut butter, and oats dropped onto wax paper and cooled to form ""cookies"" that you dont need to bake."
52_bj,5,9.0,1.0,"My favorite cookie in the form of a Ben and Jerrys ice cream? YES PLEASE! It is delicious. Go get some now, yes now!"
52_bj,1,25.0,24.0,This flavor sounded so good but it was a let down for me. The vanilla ice cream was pretty bland and the chunks weren’t so good. Very small chocolate pieces and the peanut butter cookies tasted dry and also not very flavorful. Then the core just tasted like gritty sugar. It was really strange actually because normally I love all Ben & Jerry’s flavors. I don’t get why it was called cookie dough core because it was like a gritty paste with hard chunks (maybe oats?). I was expecting it to actually be the cookie dough that’s in their other ice creams. It almost seemed like all the sugar in the container went to the core because it was so sweet (yet still not good tasting) and the rest was so bland. This was a big miss. Maybe something went wrong with this batch because I can’t imagine they would want to produce this variety if they tasted it first. I’d recommend passing on this! one.
52_bj,5,4.0,1.0,"Listen, the flavor combo = amazing. The peanut butter ice cream is rich and delicious and the vanilla balances it out. But the cookie core. The freaking. Cookie. Core. It is SO DELICIOUS. It’s chocolatey and a little peanut buttery and with little oatmeal (?) texture bits. It’s truly such an incredible flavor, I could barely stop eating the pint. Please don’t get rid of this!!!"
52_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"This is delicious. As I sit here eating this, Im thinking this is definitely one of my favorites from Ben and Jerrys. The core really complements the peanut butter cookie dough, and the texture feels so good in my mouth. This is a winner for sure."
52_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"The core tastes just like my mom’s no bake cookie recipe I loved growing up! I’m not the biggest fan of vanilla ice cream, but it’s used perfectly here to balance the richness. So hard not to eat the whole pint!"
52_bj,5,3.0,1.0,"Where has this been all my life? No-bake cookies are possibly my favorite kind of cookie, so this core is TO DIE FOR. I saw another reviewer here didnt like it because they were expecting regular cookie dough -- I am concerned that they have never eaten a no-bake cookie before, which would be terribly sad if true. In any case, theyre right: this cookie dough core is quite different from regular cookie dough. Its BETTER."
52_bj,5,3.0,0.0,"I loke trying all the B&J ice creams and this one was AWESOME! I loved the peanut butter ice cream , cookie, and the chocolate core...just delicious!!"
52_bj,5,3.0,0.0,No Bake Cookies are my favorite! This ice cream has the taste down. So good! Need to buy more and keep it in case if emergencies.
52_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"Core was great but a little disappointed in the actual ice cream flavors. The PB ice cream was underwhelming and hard to differentiate from the vanilla. Loved the peanut butter cookie chunks but could definitely use more fudge flakes, especially since the PB was so hard to taste."
52_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Eh, not my favorite. The core was very, very hard, and I had a difficult time breaking it up with my spoon. The peanut butter cookie dough wasn’t much better. It was dry and kind of flavorless - if you had me try one blindfolded, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what it was. I found myself picking out the core and peanut butter cookie dough pieces so that I could enjoy the vanilla and peanut butter ice creams, which were good. Not terrible, but won’t buy again."
52_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Seriously get this stuff!!!! My boyfriend and I ate the whole pint in one sitting
52_bj,1,2.0,1.0,"I usually can’t put the spoon down when eating this ice cream, but it wasn’t hard to do with this flavor. The cookie dough bites seemed like they were flavorless, non-sugar pieces and the peanut butter cookie pieces were also pretty bland. The ice cream itself tasted okay, but I will definitely not eat this flavor again."
52_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I purchased this today (6/3/19) at my local Kroger store. Usually, Ben and Jerrys cant be beat. However, this flavor is terrible. Very bland and the No-Bake cookie dough core is very gritty and stale tasting. I was very disappointed with this flavor pairing and would not recommend."
52_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Ive had this a few times now and my only complaint is that I wish there was more core!! Its so delicious!
53_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"I love this flavor and buy it frequently. However, in the last six months a few of my pints have been “dried out”. The brownie pieces completely crumble and the batter center is as hard as a rock. I know this isn’t how it’s suppsed to be because when it’s right its amazing and my favorite flavor. I’m attaching pictures of the dried out pieces."
53_bj,2,10.0,1.0,"Brownie batter is like a chocolate lovers dream. Unfortunately with the core series its a hit or miss, even if you find a suitable flavor you still play chance with even having one. This was essentially just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I found the core after a couple spoon fulls and it was heaven. I had a feeling itd be short lived and I was right the core disappeared before I made it to the bottom. Didnt even mind the missing brownie, just add more core !"
53_bj,2,5.0,1.0,"I got this flavor instead of my usual core flavor and was disappointed. Its not that its bad so to speak, it was just...not good. I had to force myself to eat this flavor just to not let the food go to waste. Usually Ben and Jerry use pretty good ingredients, but this time, something in the core just didnt settle taste wise with me. It tasted almost artificial. Not like brownie batter at all. I probably would have been happier with plain old chocolate or vanilla ice cream on their own. The core ruined it for me. Not to mention that there wasnt very much of it, which turned out in my favor because once the core was gone, the ice cream was slightly more enjoyable."
53_bj,3,5.0,0.0,The first few spoon fulls were amazing.. but as soon as I hit the middle section the core disappeared. The core disappearing half way through was disappointing since I was expecting the core to be consistent all the way to the bottom. Such amazing tasting ice cream just wish the core continued throughout the whole pint.
53_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Let’s say you were baking brownies and decided to lick the bowl. However, now you add in chocolate and vanilla ice cream to the mix. Sounds amazing right? Well it doesn’t stop there, now you throw in pieces of brownie to top it all off. It was like perfection in ice cream form. I think this came straight from the kitchen of the big man himself. I just sent my husband back to the grocery store because he forgot to pick up my icecream or I threatened to unrelentlessly nag him for the next hour. That’s how good it is. My core went from top to bottom like icecream intestines so I’m not sure about previous faults, but the issue appears to be solved here in SC. Good work on this one!"
53_bj,2,4.0,2.0,I bought this item but less than halfway through the pint the core disappeared Im disappointed because it was so good
53_bj,4,12.0,2.0,"Everything here worked for me, and I’ve never had a core pint that didn’t go all the way down to the bottom. The brownie and ice cream flavor and texture are perfect. My only issue is that the core itself tastes more like thick fudge than brownie. Delicious for sure but I was hoping for more a brownie batter than fudge flavor, as the pint labeling suggests."
53_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"I just bought this flavor while at Walmart the other day as a treat for the stressful week before finals. I usually get the cheapest ice cream at Walmart but figured I could splurge. I love brownie batter but found that the ""brownie batter core"" tasted nothing like brownie batter. Instead, the core was just like a chocolate fudge syrup. The description also states there would be half vanilla and half chocolate ice cream with brownie chunks surrounding the core. More than 3/4 of the ice cream in my container was chocolate. Sorry Ben & Jerrys, definitely not as good as expected."
53_bj,1,1.0,0.0,"Brownie Batter was my favorite flavor maybe 15 years ago. Its was heaven on a spoon. Then it disappeared and i was lost. When I saw this one, I was super excited that it might be close to heaven as I knew it. The brownie pieces are yummy, but the gooey batter ""core"" almost ruins this pint. Its not brownie batter at all, its a very sweet and almost artificial chocolate syrup that would be better left out. I wish i could use more delicious words to describe this flavor, but I cant lie, its a disappointment, sorry guys!"
53_bj,2,3.0,1.0,"The first several bites were really good (despite there not being any brownie pieces in the first 1/4 of the pint). The brownie batter was really good and it was overflowing but then about half way thru the pint, the brownie batter stopped. And then nothing. From then on it was just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with an occasional brownie piece. This could be a really great flavor if it was made correctly."
53_bj,3,2.0,0.0,I was slightly disappointed but there are good flavors. I wish it had more whole brownies and the core should go down to the bottom of the pint. Has lots of potential if tweaked.
53_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Ok y’all 2 star ppl need to hush about the core! Its sooo good the chocolate and vanilla and brownies! The core is just an added bonus! Loves it
53_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"This is one of the best ice cream flavors Ive ever had (Im hard to impress). I was loving the brownie core it was delicious! Until... it was gone, I wasnt even half way through the pint. I wish it lasted to the end. Regardless I loved it & will be buying it again. Hopefully, the core will be all the way through next time."
53_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Like some other reviewers, the core in this carton was sparse. What I did manage to get was soo delicious and chocolately, however halfway through the carton, the core was missing! Please think about adding more core to this ice cream, it is the best part"
53_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Its more of a dessert than an ice cream. Really full and rich.
54_bj,5,5.0,0.0,Im 8 months pregnant and this was all I wanted so I walked all the way across town to buy it at the grocery store. Its super expensive there but I HAD to have it. Ive never been so happy in my whole life. I want this ice cream everywhere in my life from now on.
54_bj,5,23.0,1.0,"If Jesus made ice cream, and not, like, carpenter-y things, he would make this. If God made this ice cream, I promise he wouldnt have bothered with the rest of creation. Hed just sit on his God couch and get wicked fat eating this all the time, except there wouldnt be time, because you know... no creation needed after the crowning achievement of the cheesecake core. Yup."
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I was in a bad mood all day, nothing was going right, was so stressed out, was watching my weight. Just a typical mom having a bad day, well late that night went in the fridge, and wanted to try the ice cream I got, never have I tried it before, can I say I couldnt put this down. This made me in such a happy mood, I cant stop telling my husband and everyone else about this delicious ice cream, it was so good that I went and got another. I hope I dont get too big, thats my worry now! Try this flavor ONLY if you like cheesecake and cookies and cream ice cream, I promise you, you will love it. Thanx again for making this one. Great job! P.s. Im super picky!"
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I had this at a sample at Winco & since then Weve purchased about 2 pints per week. & were not typically ice cream people. This is THE BEST ice cream creation ever. The cookies & cream with chunks of cheesecake make this such a wonderful combo of dessert. & prior to this, I would only eat Dryers rocky road when I eat ice cream or Venchi gelato in Italy. But now, I am in love w Ben & Jerrys."
54_bj,2,6.0,2.0,"The description of the is ice cream says it includes chocolate cookies. Per the graphic on top of the pint lid, the cookies are supposed to be distributed throughout the whole pint. To my surprise, while I was eating this ice cream their were ZERO cookies on the cheesecake side and only a few on the chocolate side. As a seasoned Ben and Jerry’s eater, I was highly disappointed."
54_bj,2,5.0,3.0,"Like most other reviewers, I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan and will be through good and not so good pints. I really didn’t like this one. The ice cream was grainy on both sides and the cheesecake ice cream was not so tasty and I ate around it. The chocolate side was good, albeit not smooth. The cheesecake core tasted great but it was very hard and there was very little of it. I ended up throwing half the pint away. Oh well, onto another new Ben and Jerry’s flavor to try."
54_bj,5,4.0,0.0,This is the best flavor of B&Js Ive found so far. I cant do nuts or bananas and this one is excellent and wont kill me!
54_bj,5,3.0,0.0,Cant stop eating it once Ive started!!! Its the best. Only wish there was a little more cheesecake filling its so tasty!!!
54_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I got this at Walmart and it was epic! The chocolate ice cream is sweet and the cheesecake ice cream tastes similar to vanilla. The chocolate cookies add a really good crunch and texture to the creamy ice cream. The core was the bomb though. It tastes exactly like actual cheesecake and is rich and dense. I 100% APPROVE THIS FLAVOR TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE.
54_bj,2,2.0,0.0,I was so excited to find this flavor! I was then disappointed by a very artificially tasting attempt at cheesecake for the ice cream and the core tasted more like thick baking glaze with too much confectioners sugar. Very disappointing. The chocolate ice cream and the cookie pieces were yummy though.
54_bj,4,2.0,0.0,"Aloha from Hawaii! Lol, I always get this flavor when Im at the store and this would TOTALLY get 5 stars if there was just a liiiiittle bit more cheesecake in the middle! I love scooping some of the middle with some ice cream around it, just wish there was more core!"
54_bj,2,2.0,0.0,"I bought this flavor a couple months ago, and never again. Cheesecake is one of my favorite flavors, but this just doesnt taste like cheesecake. It doesnt taste bad, but definitely a weaker flavor in the core line up."
54_bj,4,4.0,2.0,"I love this ice cream. However, it is sometimes a little disappointing to get close to the bottom and see there is no more core left. I buy it 2-3 time a week and sometimes the amount of cheesecake core is a little low. I love this flavor so much, please dont short the core!"
54_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Do not ever discontinue this flavor. I plan on snacking on this when Im pregnant in a few years. Good stuff.
54_bj,5,2.0,0.0,Love it; The best ice cream ever! Just delicious.
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I was at my local grocery store, wasnt really planning on buying ice cream and there was a special. I love cheesecake and in my old age I am loving chocolate ice cream and cookies more and more. Well you get all of this in one pint. Real cheesecake. I meant to take one bite to just taste it and oops, just like that it was gone. I had to go buy more."
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"Im not a fan of ice cream. This flavor is the best ice cream Ive ever had. My favorite part is the cheesecake core. If anything, I wish it was distributed more evenly. Usually towards the bottom, there is little to no cheesecake left. Youve converted me, this ice cream is great."
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,So Ive been eating this specific one for about a month or two once or twice a week. Meaning I would eat like 1-2 pints a week LOL if you love ice cream try this flavor. All of their ice creams Are to die for in general.
54_bj,2,1.0,0.0,I got a pint of this tonight and was super disappointed with how little of the core was. It tasted amazing but it didn’t last throughout and was pretty disappointing.
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"But needs more core! Why does it end not even half way unlike the other cores, the cheese cake core is the best part and best core, pleeeaseeee more core!"
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,Please. Dont ever take this away. It is the greatest flavor since you discontinued my Fudge Central
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I buy one twice a month so delicious the cheesecake core is the best !
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,My new favorite flavor. The flavor was amazing. Absolutely love it
54_bj,5,1.0,0.0,the cheesecake? the cookies? is the best it really slaps
55_bj,3,8.0,1.0,"So, this is by far the best ice cream weve ever had. Like, literally the best one. I like the vanilla, husband likes the chocolate and we fight over the core. It gets intense."
55_bj,3,4.0,0.0,Ive read all the reviews and they are correct the core does not go all the way through this product it is more like a caramel plug. Was disappointed
55_bj,5,17.0,0.0,I love this so much that I’ve honestly considered moving to VT to work in the factory so I can be so close to the creation of pure goodness. The only possible way to improve this would be to invent a time machine that comes with it so you can always go back and taste it for the first time and see the moment your life changes.
55_bj,3,12.0,0.0,"I bought this from Publix a few days ago and I loved it, until I noticed the core stopped half way through. It was very disappointing, the caramel core was my favorite part :("
55_bj,3,8.0,0.0,"I tried this and i love the combination, im just disappointed in the caramel "" core"" . I wish it went all the way to the bottom and not just half way through."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The caramel flavored ice cream is ok--it would be better as vanilla. But the combination of the chocolate flavor, the chocolate chunks, and the soft caramel core is delightful!! The only problem is that the caramel core *always* stops halfway through the pint, rendering the other half of the pint completely and totally worthless. The last pint I got, my boyfriend grabbed one small bowl of it, and there was no caramel left at all after that--there should be way more caramel since this flavor can really only be enjoyed by one person, one time before the rest of the pint is ready to be tossed. Again, good flavor, but poor execution. I would highly recommend it if there were more than a dollop of caramel."
55_bj,3,5.0,0.0,I used to love this but the last few times ive bought a tub the core stops halfway down! :-( so disappointing as the core is the best bit. The bottom half of the tub is boring! Wont be buying it anymore.
55_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Bought this for the first time expecting the core to go all the way down. It didn’t, it stopped about 1/4 of the way in. So I did research and i found it was meant to go all the down so again I bought it along with a friend who also bought the same and to our disappointment the core AGAIN stopped 1/4 of the way in. I only purchased it for the caramel centre therefore will not be buying again as I do not want just chocololate ice cream. As the was 2/3 chocolate ice cream 1/3 caramel ice cream."
55_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"PLEASE MAKE A DAIRY FREE VERSION! Ive loved this since high school when it first came out however I am lactose intolerant and it has gotten worse with age lol I love all of Ben&Jerrys dairy free products though, keep it up! :)"
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Obviosly when you read all reviews it becomes clear that it is not your intentions to have the core go all the way to the bottom. Considering how much they cost, that is really not okay. Other than that (which is quite major though), the icecream is good but the chocolate ice cream lacks a lot of taste and is quite hard and not at all as creamy as the caramel one. It could be amazing, but you have a lot to fix."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"Being gluten free its difficult to find great flavors in ice cream. I was disappointed that the caramel didnt go to the bottom, the whole reason I purchased the ice cream. I would like to continue buying the GF flavors and really hope you can add the caramel to the entire pint! Maybe some coupons will inspire me to try this flavor again!"
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"I bought a pint a few days ago and was super excited to try a new flavor! The ice-cream itself was delicious as always, but there was only a tiny bit of caramel at the top of the pint. The ""core"" aspect of this ice-cream was nonexistent. I think this was just a fluke, but for 5 bucks, it was disappointing."
55_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Yesterday we just bought a pint of this from an Earth Fare grocery. It is well within date, and the chocolate and vanilla ice creams inside were nice. BUT the supposed ""core"" of caramel was no more than a tablespoon-sized dollop at the top. No more caramel in the whole pint if ""karamel"" sutra ice cream."
55_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"... it was all caramel ice cream with the caramel core. The chocolate half is delicious but it overpowers the caramel ice cream. Also, I wish I knew what brand or how B&J makes their caramel. I could eat that alone! I always purchase this flavor. Wouldn’t trade it for anything."
55_bj,4,1.0,0.0,"This is absolutely my favorite flavor as of now. The only problem is the caramel core doesnt go all the way to the bottom. How disappointing! The one I just finished the caramel core barely went halfway down. Other than that, it is absolutely delicious."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,Just indulged a small tub of this but the caramel ran and bits and stopped im the middle. Wasnt all the way through in the centre. Really wish I had the perfect balance each time instead of only chocolate and caramel icecream and no centre
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The core does not go all the way through and is truly disappointing because thats why I buy this! It stops about a third of the way through. Second time in a row recently this has happened.
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"First, I love Ben and Jerrys. And I love all these flavors, the core is great. But it ended like a quarter of the way into the pint, which was disappointing cause it was the best part."
55_bj,2,1.0,0.0,"Brought this last night, flavour is amazing, just a shame that the core only goes down half way. Considering they cost $13 each here in Australia, not happy."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,The caramel ice cream half is amazing but the chocolate doesnt have enough flavour and the caramel core stops halfway. Salted caramel core is way better.
55_bj,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor is absolutely amazing and they really load up on the caramel. It is a perfect treat. I would give it more stars if I could.
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is great for the first half, but there’s no caramel core in the bottom half. Major disappointment."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,"The last 3-4 times Ive purchased, the core stops mid, or 2/3 of the way through."
55_bj,3,1.0,0.0,the core does not go all the way to the bottom. It stops maybe half way through.

56_bj,5,22.0,0.0,"This is by far one of the best Ben & Jerrys flavor ever created. I found this flavor in my supermarket a few weeks ago & being a chocoholic peanut butter fanatic I had to try it. A delightful swirl of ice creams,a rich chocolately and creamy peanut butter core , and tons of chocolate peanut butter cups!!! Keep up the good work Ben & Jerrys!!!"
56_bj,5,9.0,0.0,"Its hard to even find the words to describe how much I LOVE this ice cream. If ever it gets sent to the graveyard, I am not sure I would want to continue existing on such a cruel planet. Please, please, please never get rid of PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE CORE!"
56_bj,5,4.0,0.0,I have been buying this guy over and over. My freezer is always stocked with this flavor. The only bad thing Ihave to say is that not all contents of containers are created alike. Some have a lot of pb cups and some others lack those mini peanut butter cups that I love so much. I wish for more pb cups and less fudge core. Otherwise this is perfection
56_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I’m not a huge ice cream eater EXCEPT for this one! The PB Fudge Core strikes the perfect balance of both the peanut butter and chocolate to create a heavenly pint of pure yumminess. My only complaint is that it is getting harder to find! It has been unseated by more weak-kneed, lower calorie, younger siblings. They can only DREAM of being this good."
56_bj,5,2.0,0.0,"I just crushed my first pint of this one and WOW, I may have a new favorite flavor! Everything is amazing from the ice cream flavors to the mini cups and the core. It’s really a triumph of Ben And Jerry’s research and development, truth be told! Buy this, eat it and be happy!"
56_bj,5,2.0,0.0,I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core yesterday and the moment the ice cream touched my tongue I was in heaven. This ice cream is now one of my favorite ice creams ever!! Thank you for creating this ice cream.
56_bj,2,3.0,1.0,I eat ice cream for the yummy things that are in it (pieces of peanutbutter cups in this case) unfortunately I might have had in total 1 whole peanutbutter in the entire pint. Very disappointed as I love peanutbutter cups but with so very little in it I dont think Ill be getting this one again.
56_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this today after trying the cookie dough core pint which was highly disappointing. This one is 1000 times better and my new flavor. Two things I would change- more pb cups because when are there too many pb cups?? And the core didnt go all the way down
56_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I wasnt expecting something this satisfying, its perfectly balanced and no peanut butter cup will ever be worth it ever again, this ice cream has ruined me for any other brand."
56_bj,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this ice cream!! Anytime I need something sweet I grab a pint of peanut butter fudge core, Plz dont ever stop making this flavor!!!"
56_bj,5,1.0,0.0,I could die for this flavor. The peanut butter fudge core is so amazing I could eat theee pints in a day.
0_hd,5,27.0,0.0,"if this flavor is ever retired, i swear -- my lifespan might shorten by a few years. it features a perfect, not-overly-sweet, creamy base that captures the essence of cocoa butter. juxtapose that base with the just-tart-enough raspberry coulis ribbon and the bittersweet fudge truffles, and guess what -- a trifecta! i buy pints of this flavor like water; it keeps me alive. when i taste other ice creams, i often use this flavor as the benchmark to which i compare them: how does that flavor compare to WCRT? the balance in this flavor profile and/or texture variation is rarely, if ever, matched."
0_hd,5,10.0,0.0,I am an ice cream addict and this flavour has blown everything out of the water. No other ice cream of any brand or flavour holds a candle to it. It has made my previous favourites taste mediocre and lack lustre. My partner and I are absolutely bonkers about it and would love to have an easier time finding it in grocery stores or convenience stores. A couple months ago it was all over and now it has become really challenging to find it and we are devastated. We just had to share our last tub instead of having one each!
0_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"This flavor is sloop good, I eat about 2 a day sometimes 3. I picked this flavor up at a store and I thought Id never find it. I went back for more and there was no more. I went to about 15 other stores and no luck. Then, I went to the supermarket across from my house and there it was!!!!!..... my daughter cried for me because she knew how upset I was that I couldnt find and white chocolate raspberry truffle. It was right under my nose. Keep up the good work haagan daz.!!!!!!  Sincerely, your #1 fan"
0_hd,5,8.0,0.0,Best flavor ever! However I can never find this in any grocery store anymore.
0_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"I am obsessed with the ""White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle"", it is bar none better than any other ice cream I have ever had. The sweetness of the white chocolate highlights the decadent truffle chunks and the subtle tart flavor of the raspberry ribbon is a flavor explosion. I hope they never discontinue this flavor, I would cry."
0_hd,5,5.0,0.0,The day Haagen Dazs discontinue the White Chocolate Raspberry Tuffle. The day they gonn lose a customer. So please. Don’t even think about it.
0_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Oh My Goodness. I almost needed a cigarette after eating this. Yes, It IS that good."
0_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is delicious- just the right amount of sweetness. The raspberry swirls complement the dark chocolate bits wonderfully. This is my new favorite flavor!
0_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Haagen daz makes the best ice cream and this is the best of the best. I search all over for it. It is amazing!!!! I am going to go buy some now!
0_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"INCREDIBLE! Decadent flavors, great textures and oh so sinfully flavorful..."
1_hd,5,13.0,4.0,"BUT YOU DID AND I AM SO HAPPY YOU DID. This ice cream is like everything I’ve ever been waiting for... and I will be extremely sad if and when it disappears. My poor husband doesn’t like chocolate so unfortunately it’s not for him (more for me). But seriously whoever came up with this exact flavor deserves an applause because it’s now my current favorite HD pint, to precede caramel cone (for now), and mint chip. The amount of peanut butter couldn’t be more perfect, and the chips thrown about in a delightful spread of a scoop.... I can’t be more dramatic but I love it. Plain and simple. WILL buy again very soon. Thanks HD!!!"
1_hd,5,8.0,0.0,"I am obsessed with this ice cream <3 I usually go to a *ahem* certain ice cream shop that allows you to mix in whatever you like and they do this on top of a cold stone.... However, since finding this ice cream I have never gone back. They have exactly what I put into my mix but Haagen Dazs does it so much better! I hope this ice cream stays for the long run! The only thing I wish is that it has a slightly stronger banana flavor."
1_hd,5,10.0,0.0,"This is a finely-crafted ice cream, precisely and thoughtfully measured in flavor, and in terms of proportions of the chocolate and peanut butter. This ice cream is delicious. I could not be more amazed, let alone satisfied, at the high-level perfection of this wonderfully judged ice cream. Thank you."
1_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"Ive never met anyone who loves ice cream as much as I do. To be honest I eat ice cream every night so when I found this flavor I was speechless after the first bite. This is hands down THE best flavor I have ever had!! Im so in love with this ice cream that Ive actually turned friends and family onto this flavor too. Please, please, PLEASE let this flavor be here to stay! The only suggestion I can give is to make this flavor available in more stores."
1_hd,3,5.0,1.0,"This flavor pretty much marries 3 of my favorite flavors in one cup. Really awesome how 3 simple ingredients can come together so wonderfully in one pint. My only mini complaint is that I wished the peanut butter was a true ""swirl"" quality(the flavor is bomb though. Reminded me of Reeses kind of peanut butter and not like a knock off brand). Meaning that instead of having the portions seem to be scraped straight from the jar at home on your kitchen counter. Maybe try more of a melted down peanut butter sauce or syrup perhaps? To be swirled into the banana and let the chocolate pieces be the texture component? Or perhaps as a core option down the middle that the customer can get a bit of with the banana ice cream and the chunks of chocolate. Just two options to consider, as the overall flavor combination is just awesome period."
1_hd,5,6.0,1.0,This is hands down the best flavor ever! Please keep it permanently!!!!
1_hd,5,5.0,2.0,"I’m not the type of person that just sits down and eats ice cream often. Honestly, I’ve always liked salty snacks over sweet. BUT! This is the very first time that I’ve sat down and eaten and entire pint in one sitting. Did I feel bad about it? Absolutely. But this flavor was SO delicious that I couldn’t summon the willpower to stop myself. I could eat this on the daily."
1_hd,5,2.0,0.0,What a wonderful blend of flavors and texture! Delicious! I reminds me of my most favorite flavor that disappeared long ago- vanilla peanut butter swirl..... perhaps a comeback is in order?
1_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"The banana ice cream is amazing, the flavor isn’t overpowering and has a very real tast. The peanut butter chunks throughout the ice cream is the perfect addition to the banana ice cream and the chocolate chips add the perfect little crunch!"
1_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is one of the best flavors I like.The banana ice cream with peanut butter and bits of chocolate is a scoop of heaven in a pint. Please, please bring this flavor back. My happiness would be improved with this ice cream in my freezer and bowl. I am connoiseur of Haagen Dazs so help me please :)"
1_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love the taste and texture of this ice cream. I love the dozen chunks of peanut butter with the perfect creamy banana ice cream and the balance of chocolate chip. My only problem is that all the stores in my area stopped carrying this last year. PLEASE HELP! I need my fix
1_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is by far my favorite ice cream I have ever gotten from a grocery store. However, in the past few months I cant find it anywhere. Are you still making it? How do I get it at my local grocery? I am craving it so bad and other banana ice creams are just not the same."
1_hd,3,1.0,0.0,Peanut butter and chocolate notes over power any banana (if any is present). Expected banana flavor when banana is first in the name. 8 adults sampling liked the ice cream but could not discern a banana note.
1_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love this flavor. Its incredible!! I wish all local stores werent out of stock!
1_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I was super excited to try this flavor but there was way to much peanut butter.
2_hd,5,44.0,3.0,"The moment I saw that it had my two favorite ingredients, I knew Haagen-Dazs had created a secret covert mission to sabotage my diet. And you have succeeded too. I will literally drive around to all 3 Walmarts, and all 3 Country Marts, just to see if they are stock. Usually, they are not in stock but when they are I bring my 55gal cooler container to transport my Prized selections back to my 1.2 cubit ft freezer....... ha ha ha ha! Please make this in the Gallon size....I am still on a diet. OOO and by the way can I get some coupons or maybe a trip to try all of your newest flavors....cant hurt to ask. Love this stuff!!!!"
2_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"Normally I eat a pint of Haagen-dazs in two or three settings. But this Bourbon Praline Pecan flavor, it gets devoured all at one time.... and I have no shame! This is by far my favorite ice cream. Its bold flavor is for bold pallets and definitely lives up to the hype! The bourbon is present but not overpowering, the pecans create the perfect bite and add great texture, and all the elements that make this perfect flavor ar wrapped up in a sweet, creamy, decadent ice cream. Its by far the best ice cream Ive ever had. I wish I could buy it in bulk! Haagen-dazs, please dont ever discontinue this flavor as my heart would forever be broken. ITS JUST THAT GOOD!"
2_hd,5,6.0,0.0,Wow Fantastic it’s really replaced my favorite flavor great taste
2_hd,3,8.0,1.0,"Two days ago I wrote a 5 star review for this when I heard it was coming back. Since then I found a ""pint"" (actually 14 oz) at Publix. I was looking forward to it until I actually tried it. I doubt it is the one I raved about a few years back when they first introduced it as a special flavor. Now it is so sweet that the bourbon flavor is drowned out, and I thought I remembered the praline as crunchy. Now it is the same goop they put in Dulce de leche. So this is basically Dulce de leche with pecans, because the essence of bourbon is unrecognizable. I would add that there are a lot of new good flavors. (e.g. Trio of Chocolate) This one is just not what it used to be, and you can ignore my 5 star review of two days ago."
2_hd,5,15.0,2.0,"I am in TOTAL LOVE with this flavor! Like I literally buy everything off the shelf! I have introduced it to several of my friends and they have shared with their friends, so now its a fight of who gets to the store first!!! This flavor is truly a hit that I hope they keep around for a long time! I wonder if they will indulge and try to make a Bourbon Butter Pecan Praline flavor!!! It makes for a perfect gift to anyone that is having a bad day! Mmmmm....mmmmm....GOOODDDD!!!"

2_hd,5,22.0,1.0,"Please, please, please do not ever discontinue this flavor! Besides my familys homemade vanilla, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. I try to limit myself to 2 to 3 pints a week. Is that bad????"

2_hd,5,2.0,1.0,OMG...!! This is the best ice cream Ive ever had in my life. Im in love with everything about the bourbon praline pecan ice cream. There is an smooth creamy richness with a little bit of crunch that makes the flavor its outstanding. The Bourbon is just right. Please dont change a thing about it. Well except for the size. I wished I had a larger container of the ice cream. I like the bourbon praline pecan cream way better than the rum raisin ice cream. Im not a big fan on raisins anyway and the rum raisin ice cream makes me a little bit nauseous. Bourbon is the new Rum.!! Mmmmm...!!
2_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"Hands down, this is the best ice cream ever! I was intrigued when the flavor came out a few years ago, blown away by the first bite, and then became obsessed with tracking it down when it started to disappear from shelves. The word ""euphoria"" comes to mind when I think about how I felt when I saw that it was back! The flavor is complex, decadent, mature...everything you never even thought ice cream could even be, but somehow Haagen Dazs made possible!"

2_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"when this flavor left the shelves a few years back, i was crushed. i knew it was a limited edition, but still -- when it went away, i was crestfallen. now that it has made its return, my tastebuds are rejoicing. the creamy base is loaded with bourbon flavor, and the swirl adds an appropriate level of sweetness. the flavor is rounded out by the praline pecans, which add just the right amount of bitterness. a definite keeper, and one of my all-time favorites that H-D has featured over the years."
2_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I am not a bourbon drinker, but I love this ice cream! The combination of flavors and textures is perfect, the pralines are exactly the right balance to the bourbon caramel. I have found that some pints have had a stronger bourbon taste, which I prefer. Between the husband and myself, a pint seems to evaporate almost immediately! I hope this is a permanent flavor, my new favorite! Although the bananas foster was also good, maybe bring that back too!?"
2_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I have literally been eating these by the 14oz container! I can only find them in Food Lion here in Woodbridge, VA. I cannot find them in any other store.

I’m prepapred to stock up for as long as I can if it is. Yes it’s that good! Please don’t be a holiday flavor! Thanks HaagenDaz <3"

I didn’t like ice cream and I didn’t buy ice cream, but after that faithful day, I now purchase two pints on every trip to the grocery store. I am addicted! Please sell it in gallon size or better yet in single serve size. That might keep me from eating the entire pint at once!"

I have read some of the negative reviews and I cant believe my eyes! Some people think the bourbon flavor is too strong and others think it is too weak. Well, I guess that proves you cant please everyone. I think the truffle pieces are perfect, too. Just the right amount of sweetness and they melt in my mouth without leaving any fatty residue...a BIG plus. LOVE IT!"

3_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I have had two flavors of this product line so far and I have really enjoyed them! I have to say these are pints to savor not eat in one sitting. They are decadently flavored and quite rich. The Vanilla is my absolute favorite. The Parline Pecan was good as well but it isnt gluten free so I could only taste a bite.
3_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"It tastes like straight bourbon. I was expecting a vanilla caramel with maybe a bourbon swirl or tinge, but it literally tastes like you’re taking a shot with every bite.

This ice cream is a good price when comparing to competitors, it was more reasonably priced than both brands near it at the store, and you know youre getting quality when you buy Haagen Dazs ! We will definitely be going back for more Haagen Dazs ice cream in the future."

4_hd,1,5.0,1.0,For years your brand was my best of all! I figured Ill enjoy some Butter Pecan on this Sunday evening. What the HECK happened???? Please explain this ice cream is NOT buttery anymore. Its plain and taste worst than Vanilla. More nuts but its useless if there isnt any flavor in the nut or the icecream. Double whammy of a waste! Now I have to experiment with different Brands to find a favorite. I really hate starting over but my relationship with you guys are OVER!!
4_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"After the 1st spoonful you can taste the creamy deliciousness of this ice cream. Its rich and full of flavor. Its premium ice cream and you can taste the quality. Definitely will be trying other flavors, needs to be available in larger sizes to accommodate larger families."
4_hd,1,5.0,1.0,"I have not indulged in ice cream in a while due to dietary restrictions and issues with dairy, however, I took the plunge this evening while joining in on birthday festivities with family. I am SO disappointed. I feel like a was cheated and should have picked the birthday cake instead of the Butter Pecan Haagen-Dazs. The flavor is not as good as I remember. The texture and taste were off. This was very noticeable after the first spoonful, so much so that I found myself checking and double checking the expiration date a second and third time to see if the ice cream has expired."

4_hd,2,5.0,2.0,"I am not sure when the recipe changed, but what use to be delicious creamy ice cream tastes like sweet ice milk with pecans. This is no long my brand of choice when I want butter pecan ice cream."
4_hd,4,1.0,0.0,Loved the great flavor of butter pecan soft ice cream. Got the sample from tryitsampling and now ill be a customer for life. Excited to try many more great flavors from this inventive company. Butter pecan might not be everyones favorite but its becoming mine!
4_hd,4,1.0,0.0,I am so happy with this flavor! I had never tried Haagen- dazs and I am impressed! The taste didnt seem artificial either which can be an issue I find with ice cream. I received a free sample courtesy of Bazaarvoice Try It Sampling.
5_hd,5,5.0,0.0,these are wonderful ! Where have they been. LOVE the coating
5_hd,4,3.0,0.0,"Theres quite a difference between the caramel and vanilla bars, probably because the caramel makes the texture creamier, while the vanilla ice cream is icy and crystalline. Further, the chocolate dip combines better with the caramel for a better overall flavor as well. This is reflected in the caramel flavor being out of stock more. Dont buy the vanilla."
5_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"Wow, the chocolate coating is a winner! This is a ""must try"". The flavor stopped my husband and I in our tracks as it was the best ice-cream bar we have ever had! WELL DONE Haagen-Dazs! SO good!!"

5_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Wow, I just decided to pick this ice cream up just because it looked good. All I can say is, is that I’m glad I did! This ice cream bar literally melts in your mouth. The chocolate is incredibly soft and there’s the perfect amount of caramel inside. Amazing job with this one. I will never get another ice cream bar again!"
5_hd,5,1.0,0.0,These are amazing! I love hand dipped cones right before they harden and somehow they created that texture perfectly. I didnt expect it to be dark chocolate though so it should probably be labeled better.
6_hd,5,12.0,2.0,"I happened upon this ice cream because I had a coupon for a free pint. So last weekend while my daughter and I were at the grocer, I told her to pick out a flavor. I finally tasted today. Absolutely delicious! So creamy, with the crunchy cone contrast! I am a die-hard fan of the somewhat local, little creamery in Brenham, but now I must say I have a new love. I believe this is my first time even tasting Haagen Dazs. Dont know what took me so long, but glad I stepped outside of my comfort zone. Its not cheap, so this will be my go-to for a ""special"" treat. Yum!"
6_hd,5,7.0,1.0,"a mainstay in H-Ds lineup for good reason: its of the best in H-D has to offer. only a handful of flavors get the larger packaging treatment, and this is one of them. a not-too-sweet, base, coupled with a sweet, yet slightly ""toasted"" caramel swirl (almost brown-buttery) is then littered (in a good way) with chocolate-covered cone pieces that remain crunchy. whats not to like? answer: nothing. as far as taste and texture is concerned, it has all the right things going for it."
6_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"My mom had bought herself couple of the caramel cone ice cream. As she was enjoying her ice cream I looked at it and asked her if it was good. I’m not a huge fan of caramel. When she told me it was good , I had to try it. I loved it; it wasn’t too much caramel as I expected. Now this is one of my favorite ice cream!"
6_hd,5,6.0,0.0,Caramel Cone very good! One of my favorites! Love the caramel swirls and pieces of chocolate coated sugar cone.
6_hd,5,5.0,1.0,My boyfriend and I bought a few different favors for date night and Caramel Cone was one niether of us had before. It’s our new favorite! Grocery shopping isn’t complete without Caramel Cone in the cart to bring home.
6_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Love the tiny container, the cone pieces are smaller and stay crunchy. The bigger container, no so much. The cone pieces are bigger and tend to be soft and mushy. The ice cream in the bigger container dont taste the same to me either. Still good but the tiny one is amazing. Wish theyd use the smaller cone pieces in the bigger containers, Im having trouble finding the tiny cup. Really missing my new favorite tiny ice cream LOL"
6_hd,5,3.0,1.0,Perfect givea u the best of all worlds. Rite now Im on a caramel kick . plus the Graham cracker cones . this u get those but u dont have to eat a whole cone so its perfect
6_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"I don’t like ice cream, but I am here to tell you that this ice cream is so good!! I am hooked."
6_hd,5,3.0,2.0,This to me is one of the yummiest ice creams on the planet especially one you can buy in a grocery store! Such beautifully balanced flavors coming together in the most amazing way your taste buds will forever thank you. Awesome try it!!!
6_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is unbelievable. Everyone can agree that the best bite of an ice cream cone is the one at the end, where you get the sweet of the ice cream mixed with the melty chocolate and crispy cone in a delicious harmony of perfect flavor. Every bite is the perfect one in this ice cream!!"
6_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is hands down the best flavor made by Haagen Dazs! Each bite is packed with so much goodness. Love the caramel flavor and all of the bits included. Always sad when the spoon hits the bottom.
7_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"Okay so the other day I was walking back from the supermarket and it was a hot day, I decided to stop by the gas station and I was trying to decide between come ice creams that I love or this brand which I haven’t had in well over 5 years. I decided the get the cookie exterior since I’m not a fan of almonds or whatever... ohhhh myyyy G!!! It was fantastic!!! The outside has a chocolatey sweet exterior with a delicious and simple interior of perfect vanilla and just the right amount of salt from the caramel!!! My new favorite forever even if I spent like $5 for one bar. Sooo much better than ben n jerries and doesn’t make me feel sick afterwards! Thank you!!!"
7_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"This is the only bar worthy to buy every time to satisfy your need for a frozen treat. The gelato inside is creamy and smooth, and not even a careless supermarket can ruin it with their melt & re-freeze tactics that cause crystals. This is due to the gelato being so fine it doesnt have the air bubbles like typical ice creams that can be ruined fast during shipping and storage. So when you want good quality - the supermarket is least likely to ruin your experience if you choose the gelato bar. Then you have those caramel ribbons in between the gelato - very nice, not hard, not too liquid, just right to go with the smooth gelato. And on top theres the real chocolate with crunchy pizzelle bits that finish a perfect experience of chocolate with a satisfying crunch."
7_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"Wondering why I have such a difficult time finding the gelato bars stores are well stocked with ice cream bars.I go to 3 to 4 stores 3x a week looking. Sams,Krogers,Randalls, ,Targets and HEB.Is there some way I can get them.Ice cream hurt my stomach the gelato does not and it taste better to me"
7_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Omg. At first I was buying another brand of almond ice cream. Oneday i tried this bar and I was hooked. By far the best ice cream ive ever had. The only problem is i cant find it by the big box the dollar general only has single bars! Im good with that though!!
7_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"i agree with every good sentiment left by the other reviewers. It is the all-time best ice cream bar. I would patron any place that carried them. But, little by little, it disappeared and I can no longer find them. Are they discontinued?"
7_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I get these bars all of the time as an ""end of the day"" treat. They have the perfect amount of caramel and gelato. They do not disappoint. My roommates and I always have to buy multiple boxes because they disappear so quickly."
7_hd,5,2.0,0.0,this is got to be the best gelato and remain problem is I cant ever find stores they keep it in stock I bought five boxes at a time believe me they are that good
7_hd,2,3.0,2.0,The base recipe has been changed. Haagen Daaz used to be very creamy with a rich mouth feel but thelast two pints I tried tasted more like ice milk instead of ice cream. I will be switching to other brands that are still premium quality.
8_hd,1,5.0,4.0,"Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream is about $5.25 a pint in Sacramento, Ca. purchased the (3) pints at my local store. Went to eat the Last Pint an saw that there were no cherries in the Ice Cream, well maybe 1 1/2 in the whole pint...""WHAT"" 8-( 8-( 8-("
8_hd,5,9.0,1.0,This is my new favorite ice cream and I’m concerned that it’s so rare it’s going to be hard to continue to buy. But it is truly amazing. This is what I’ve akways wanted in ice cream flavor. I’m very genuine when I say it’s perfect!!! I hope this flavor continues for a LONG time!
8_hd,5,6.0,0.0,Blows Cherry Garcia out of the water! Better texture and flavor and without the chocolate chunks.
8_hd,5,4.0,0.0,Vanilla Swiss Almond has always been my favorite but NOW Cherry Vanilla is my new favorite. Its addictive. Thank you for such a wonderful treat.
8_hd,1,4.0,0.0,Had very good flavor. But at $5 a pint and only had (6) total cherries in it. At the cost I dont think I will be buying it again.

8_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is such a smooth, easy, delicious eat! The cherries blend perfectly with the vanilla - its not overly sweet the way these flavours can sometimes be. Theres also none of that awful artificial cherry flavour."
8_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"A very wonderful ice cream that is now truly one of my favorites, minus a good peach ice cream which few people make. Hint hint."
8_hd,5,1.0,0.0,So so good. Get it every other time (when I’m not getting rum tres leches). Always have plenty of cherries.
8_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Blows Cherry Garcia out of the water! Better texture and flavor and without the chocolate chunks.
9_hd,5,7.0,4.0,Haagen-dazs has never failed me for a true indulgent pick me up. I love the creamy consistency of the icecream and the smooth flavor of the crunchy chocolate shell. Its priced just right at your local grocery store for a 3 pack.
9_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"The taste of this Haagen-Dazs Chocolate Ice Cream reminds me of what the classic fudgsicle on a stick used to taste like, before it was turned into just another concoction of frozen additive weirdness. This Haagen-Dazs chocolate ice cream is made the old fashioned way, with no junky additives, just the essential good stuff.As a comparison, when you go to your local supermarket, check the ingredients of all the famous name ice creams available. Chances are, you will be looking at more gums and chemical additives that you really want to deal with. Yuck. Buy Haagen-Dazs ice creams, no-nonsense ice creams made the way ice creams used to be made."
9_hd,5,4.0,1.0,"While the package is on the small side , the flavor is huge. Its so very decandant and creamy . I love the flavor of the chocolate best chocolate I have ever had . Highly addictive and flavorful They do need bigger family sizes"
9_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"This is my go-to ice cream!! I never eat other chocolate ice cream—it just cant compare. With other chocolate ice cream, I cant eat much because I feel full of the flavor. The Häagen Dazs chocolate flavor is perfect though! It tastes better than any other ice cream and I never feel tired of it. Its magic. Also, check out the ingredients!!"
9_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"Love this ice cream the chocolate is the best! Its a rich intense flavor. My kids love it too! Also love the ice cream bars, they are so fancy and taste so great! Looking forward to trying all the different kinds of Haagen Dazs! A new favorite brand for me!"
9_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"Ive tried so many brand of Ice cream, to be honest Haagen-dazs is best one for over the counter Ice cream product, the chocolate flavour is so real and the texture so creamy, also have perfect flavor, I love it"

9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is so decadent and so delicious. I love it with just about everything. Banana, strawberries. Potato chips. But lately it is getting so hard to find. There seems to be every other kind of ice cream but my beloved chocolate. I’m really missing that creamy taste. You do 1 thing try the chocolate. You won’t be disappointed."

9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Haagen-dazs chocolate ice cream is great tasting! If you like chocolate ice cream this is a must try! Smooth, rich flavor with just the right chocolate flavor. Wish it came in a larger amount so the whole family could indulge with a bowl full! Would recommend!"
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I received a sample of the product for my honest review. All opinions are only mine. For this hot season. These ice cream bars cover the craving needs of something sweet. They really are delicious and contain the exact portion to enjoy on these sunny days.
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I tried the Haagan Daaz Chocolate ice cream and it was awesome! It was so creamy and delicious, definitely the best chocolate ice cream Ive ever had and would but again a million times. I would but this ice cream in pretty much every flavor they have."
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Im not much of an ice cream eater, but this is the creamiest, flavorful coldness Ive ever put in my mouth. Haagen-Dazs has outdone themselves with this ice cream, it actually taste like ice cream instead of ice chips. Enjoy this cup full of flavor!"
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is a wonderful chocolate ice cream. It is very creamy and packed with chocolate flavor!! It is easy to eat the whole container. It is definitely some of the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had! I will buy this again!!
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,i love how this taste. Its super creamy and has a very bold chocolate flavor. It makes the perfect snack. The chocolate flavor is perfect and it has a milk chocolate flavor. The creaminess level is also perfect.
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I tried the new flavor with layers and it was a so good! It was crunchy and creamy. Its hard to stop eating once you start. I ate mine right out of the container. Highly recommend! Will buy over and over!

9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite cream. Where can I find the 64 ozs in Ft Worth/Dallas, Texas?"
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The best tasting ice cream out there! It is very creamy similar to Gelato!
9_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite, period. If I cant find it, I go without."
10_hd,1,5.0,1.0,"I was looking forward to the decadent treat that is the chocolate bar with dark chocolate coating, so was disappointed and frankly sort of sort of grossed out by what I bought instead. During the current COVID nightmare, I have turned to HD ice cream as my guilty pleasure - every night just about! I love the squares with the “cake” layer that I discovered recently (but the calories, I don’t even want to guess) but also love the tried and true hard chocolate on chocolate bars. But the texture of the “soft dip” turned me off completely and the ice cream too does not seem as rich and creamy. I won’t get used to this product and indeed, gave the remaining two bars away."
10_hd,2,12.0,1.0,"My husband came home with these not realizing they were different from the ones we usually buy. Right away, I was suspicious of the word chocolaty - which means fake. Breyers went down this road - a formerly great brand had to started to call it Frozen Dairy Dessert. These bars solve a problem that doesnt exist - the chocolate used to be amazing and high quality, and to save money they added disgusting Palm OIl (isnt that the one that ruins the environment??) to save money (and yes, make it soft. Like, who cares?). The only redeeming feature about these bars is you can peel off the waxy coating and eat the ice cream, which so far is real Haagen Dazs. Ive eaten this brand since pints had 16oz and really dont know what possessed them to create these."
10_hd,2,6.0,0.0,"The only reason I bought this is because I didn’t see the original on the shelf. The chocolate is soft but it’s not the same quality as the original and it tastes slightly bitter like dark chocolate-something they should state on the package. The ice cream itself also didn’t taste as creamy as it normally does, kind of icy. I know times are tough for everyone but it’s obvious they tried to cut corners and to make up for it, they just marketed it like it’s something new or innovative. If I wanted a soggy popsicle, I would have just bought a fudge bar!"
10_hd,1,6.0,0.0,"I have been eating the chocolate bars for many years. I have loved them and purchase them all of the time. This new ""Soft Dipped"" is not even close to the way it used to be and I think is a very bad decision on the part of the company. I have no idea what research (if any) came up with this idea, but it may be one of the worst since Coca-Cola changed its formula. I bought three boxes. I ate one bar so far, and am not looking forward to eating the other eight. Shame, shame, shame."
10_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"In addition to quietly reducing weight from 82 g to 77 g per bar (i.e. >6% reduction), the so-called ""soft dipped"" with ""soft chocolate truffle coating"" is loaded with more sugar, whose granularity can be felt right away--a hallmark of cheap chocolates--and palm oil instead of cocoa butter (apparently HD knows how to get around FDAs definition of chocolate; using the adjective ""chocolaty"" let them get away with less-expensive non-cocoa butter). BTW, increasing the sugar content is primarily responsible for the softness since sugar lower the freezing point."
10_hd,1,6.0,1.0,"Admittedly I havent had Haagen Daz very regularly for years now. I remember their ice cream being thick, rich and creamy. The chocolate inside this bar is nothing like I remember their chocolate tasting like. Its flavorless and icy. It tastes like some kind of low fat alternative or vegan ice cream."
10_hd,1,4.0,0.0,I just gave one of these bars a second chance thinking a Haagen Dazs bar had to be better than what I remembered these bars tasting like. The texture of both the ice cream and chocolate coating is off and theres no flavor at all- very unsatisfying. I definitely wouldnt buy these again.
10_hd,1,4.0,0.0,"Bought these by mistake. Icky waxy fake chocolate tasting coating that sticks to your teeth -- and hands and clothes and anything else in the vicinity. Like other reviewers, I peeled the nasty coating off and just ate the vanilla ice cream."
10_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this, it’s so decadent it gives me a chocolate high. My new favorite treat, every bite is satisfying."
11_hd,1,6.0,1.0,"I use to be so in love with this flavor! Like, eating-a-pint-a-week-every-week-for-years in love! I’m so disappointed in the reformulation. The new recipe is extremely lacking. It’s not creamy at all is tastes kind of blank and watered down. For sure not worth the calories. I threw mine away.. Too bad. This was my favorite ice cream ever second to Mint Chocolate Chip."
11_hd,1,6.0,1.0,Ugh. Had this tonight and the cookie dough chunks taste totally different. Like fake or chemically or something. Did you change the recipe???
11_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This here lies the greatest ice cream of all times. Haagen-Dazs chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is hands down, by far, the most delectable, devine, exquisite, greatest creation of all time - gift from God and I am not even religious - ice cream that you will ever taste. If you close your eyes and taste this ice cream, you might pass out from overwhelming creamy sweetness that is just right. Period."
11_hd,1,7.0,3.0,"I used to love this flavor, now its horrible. Watered down ice cream? Hardly any cookie dough chunks? What a disaster, a change of formula to save money. Ill be purchasing something else in the future."
11_hd,4,4.0,1.0,Cookie dough is my favorite favorite! The ice cream is great and the cookie dough pieces are soft.. unlike other brands.. I love this brand I just wish there were more cookie dough pieces.. thanks
11_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"After buying the ice cream I decided to read the reviews. I noticed that most did not like the lack of cookie dough. Honestly, the ice cream is great and rich. Does not need more cookie dough because that would take away from the ice cream. Haagen Daz is known for ice cream and this is a great blend of the rich vanilla, chocolate chips, and cookie dough. Not too much but very satisfying."
11_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"I’ve been eating this ice cream since it was “Cookie Dough Chip.” It’s been one of my favorite flavors since I was a kid. I bought a pint yesterday and I had to write this review. The taste is poor and not what it used to be. I’m sorry to say it tastes like a much cheaper brand. The chocolate chips leave a weird after taste and the cookie dough itself does not taste the same. I’m really disappointed in the change. I was looking at Cookies and Cream in the store and noticed that it had soy in it, so I purchased the chocolate chip cookie dough instead. I didn’t pay attention to the ingredients until I got home. After giving it try I don’t think the quality of the product is worthy of the Haagen dazs name. It really did taste like an off- brand product. “24:52 00:47 9315580431” P.S. I have a bit of an allergy to dairy and STILL purchase your products b/c it was always a worthwhile indulgence. I don’t want this to be another product I have to give up. Is there a way to go back to not using soy lecithin, corn oil, etc?"
12_hd,5,17.0,0.0,"This item is beyond doubt the very best that I can find anywhere. No other Ice cream thats out there can match you chocolate chocolate chip. This explains why its always sold out almost every time I go looking for it. You could sell a lot more of it if you would put much more of it on the store shelves. Usually, I can only find it once a month, because its always sold out, and with good reason. Everybody likes it, and everybody buys it. Perhaps you could double the amount you put on the store shelves. I would certainly be grateful. P.S. Please dont consider changing the recipe. It s perfect the way it is. Thanks"

PAHLEESE say it aint so.... please, please, I beg of you...BRING IT BACK!!!!"
12_hd,5,11.0,0.0,"My feelings with chocolate chocolate chip stem from a purely emotional place. As a young girl, while visiting my grandparents in an extremely small west Texas town, we always bonded over this flavor and this brand. My grandmother would drive over 1.5 hours to find this specific ice cream, normally found on base, and she had a special cooler to put it in so our treasured gold would make it home semi-frozen."
12_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"This is by far the best flavor by Häagen Dazs ever! It is the most perfect chocolate chocolate chip that anybody has ever tried to make! I love so many of the Häagen-Dazs flavors, it is the only kind of ice cream I will eat! Everybody who has another favorite flavor and tries this one, my favorite, ends up falling in love! I hope you never discontinue this amazing classic! We grew up on this flavor and it is full of decadence and wonderful memories with each bite!"
12_hd,4,5.0,0.0,This creamy/crunchy deliciousness is AWESOME!!! Its creamy with a little bit of crunch to it thanks to the chocante chips. I love this flavor but sad that they dont have it in bigger cartons. I couldnt find this ice cream for a while then recently found it but they only sell it in small cartons which I finish in a day or a couple of hours because its that good. Please make bigger portions of this ice cream.

12_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Haagen-Dazs chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is the best ice cream ever the little chips that snap when you eat them give it a great texture. This is the only ice cream I eat. Im having a hard time finding it now hardly any of the stores carry it. You should advertise this more on TV as I think making more people aware of it would be the key to selling it. Anyone that I have told about it or giving it to have become hooked on it and love it

12_hd,2,1.0,0.0,The chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is not very good! The ice cream is fine but the chips are like wax! They have no flavor and don’t even melt in your mouth if you leave them sitting in your mouth. I’m disappointed because I love the Belgian chocolate up ice cream but no stores in my area carry it anymore. They’re only carrying the new style of Häagen-Dazs . What a bummer! I’ll have to hunt for something else.

12_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"I bought 3 pints of CCC. I am addicted to good chocolate and I expected nothing but the best when I bought Haagen-Dazs. I thought my issue would be how not to eat all 3 pints in a day or so. The ice cream was good but the chocolate chips were such a disappointment. I love chocolate but I spit them all out. They were flavorless, waxy, like eating candle wax or crayons. I seriously didnt expect that. For the first time ever, I am complaining about chocolate but the chips are not like chocolate, theres no taste, it doesnt melt. I was going to write you but while reading everything on the container trying to figure out what the chips actually are, I saw you welcome contact so here I am. I thought I cant be the only one who is disappointed in the chips. I did see a few that felt exactly the same as I did but for the most part people seem to love it, because of the chips. I just dont understand it. Is it possible you add something to the chips to keep them from melting. But they dont have any flavor either. Is it something like cilantro where the taste buds of some people love it and the taste buds of others detest it? I am one of those that cilantro tastes like soap. I already know I love chocolate, its just that your chips are nasty to me and you have a ton of them in the container so theres a lot of spitting out chips. I still cant believe I am spitting chocolate out but its like trying to eat tasteless crayon chunks. When I give stars below, it will be for the ice cream only. For me, Ill just never buy chips again. Sorry"

13_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Want chocolate? Want crunch? This is the bar that satisfies. The snap of the chocolate on the outside, because it is real chocolate, is perfect. And Haagen Dasz chocolate ice cream is the best: smooth and intense. I like mine just a touch melty, so the chocolate shell slides off the easily, in a word its decadent."
14_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"This is absolutely the best ice cream I have had in two years! It has been that long since I have been lactose intolerant, allergic to almonds and sensitive to soy and coconut milk. Most dairy free ice creams contain one of my allergens/sensitivities (soy and coconut oil in this, but not milk). It tastes amazing! Even my boys love them and couldn’t tell the difference. So creamy, rich and chocolaty. Haagen-Dazs, you just changed my world! Thank you!"
14_hd,5,5.0,1.0,"I am so grateful for these. They taste fantastic, and my allergic kids have eaten their first ice cream bars EVER! My 13 year old has to sit at lunch everyday and watch kids eat ice cream while he cant. This is just the best day for him. My 11 year old had his first last week, and I cried when he announced it was his ""first ice cream bar ever!"" It really sunk in, the reality of food allergies. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
14_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I wandered down the frozen treat aisle dejected, lactose intolerant and disappointed. Then... I saw it, non dairy, chocolate, and it looked so satisfying. I tossed it in my cart and hurried home so it wouldn’t melt. The taste was amazing! Soft, creamy, and unlike other non dairy themed products I’ve tried before leaves no discomfort or digestive issues. I loved the coating, and the chocolate bite inside it. This exceeded all my expectations! I only wish there were more in the box!"
14_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I actually had to come on here and triple check there was no milk in them. Both my son and myself are allergic to milk but love chocolate. I just wish it was sold in larger quantities and I hope it doesnt get discontinued like the chocolate sorbet.
14_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Honestly, the only problems with these bars are that I cannot stop eating them and they don’t sell more flavours anywhere near me!"
14_hd,5,1.0,0.0,If youre vegan but also a chocoholic like me youll love these. I couldnt even tell they were non dairy. My new favorite
14_hd,5,1.0,0.0,These are the most amazing ice cream bars on planet Earth!
15_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"My New Favorite flavor ice cream! When you get the best of both worlds, chocolate & chicks of peanut butter. Just the flavor alone when you bite into the chocolate ice cream you get that hint of peanut butter. Thinking that was it, but the more you scoop into it you then realize when you scoop actual chunks of smooth peanut butter inside. Score!! I just love the chunk of peanut butter & chocolate together. A perfect match!"
15_hd,5,6.0,0.0,I have to admit that this was the first time I tried this brand but I always wanted to. I had a coupon and sure enough gave it a try. I enjoy trying new things. Im not big on chocolate but I wanted to try it since it had the peanut butter added.I squeezed the sides a little and the top popped right off with no struggle. As I took my first bite I was so impressed with the flavor and how it just melted in my mouth with every bite. Its one of the softest icecream Ive ever tried.First you taste the chocolate but after a few bites then there it came the chuck of peanut butter. Not just one chunck but several chuncks through out the icecream. I really enjoyed how you could easily break the peanut butter chuncks into several pieces with your spoon or choose to indulge it all at once. To my suprised these two flavors combined made It a flavor I couldnt get enough of and I actually liked chocolate for once after trying this icecream.It was so satisfying and filled me up and the texture to the flavor was balanced out perfectly. perfectly. I really recommend trying this icecream as there is s flavor for everyones cravings!
15_hd,5,7.0,0.0,I love ice cream. Real ice cream with real ingredients. Haagen-daz Chocolate Peanut Butter May just be the most perfect ice cream ever. The chocolate ice cream is smooth and creamy while the ribbons of peanut butter compliment the chocolate taste. Yum!!!
15_hd,1,12.0,1.0,"I have been eating this flavor for years, but you have totally changed it, and ruined it. Last fall I got one carton that was like this and I thought it was a mistake, and then the next one was the same so I stopped buying it. About February I took a chance a bought one and it was the wonderful dark chocolate ice cream with the big blops of peanut butter. Then just recently it’s back to the super sweet lighter chocolate with thin chards of peanut butter which doesn’t taste like anything and in my opinion so disappointing. Please return to the old formula, or you need to change the carton because it’s not what’s advertised. You have lost a customer."
15_hd,2,17.0,1.0,"Omg, please change the recipe back to the original with the delicious peanut butter ribbons distinctively separate from the chocolate ice cream. Its what made it THE BEST! Now its just ok. Tastes like it was stuck in a blender. The people who LOVE this ice cream, loved it for that reason. Why ruin a good thing. I used to love digging through the ice cream trying to break off pieces of salty peanut butter, now its no fun. Im not gonna lie, it still tastes good, but its NOT nearly comparable to the original. Please stop the insanity and bring it back."
15_hd,2,14.0,0.0,"I looked this up to see if my disappointment over the Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream was all in my head. I see others are having the same experience. Gone are the wide swaths of peanut butter that made me so happy. I bought another yesterday to see if perhaps the first was a bad batch. To my dismay, no. Little shavings, little flavor. Even the ice cream is lacking. I had forgiven the fact that you no longer give us a full pint because this Chocolate Peanut Butter is the cheapest therapy ever, but this is not okay."
15_hd,1,6.0,0.0,Like other recent reviews the last few times I bought this it hasnt been the same ice cream. None of the fantastic peanut butter chuncks that used to make it one of the best.
15_hd,1,12.0,0.0,"My mom and I have obsessed over this ice cream over the past few years. Last month she bought three pints and every single one of them was missing the delicious big chunks of peanut butter. Without that, it is not worth buying the Haagen-Dazs. We are very sad."
15_hd,1,8.0,0.0,"What happened to my beloved chocolate peanut butter ice cream?? Its got weird shavings on top now instead of the creamy chocolate ice cream and ribbons of peanut butter. Its been like this the last 3 pints Ive bought. I even bought at different stores thinking it may have been a bad batch or something. What did you do?? This was THE ABSOLUTE BEST ICE CREAM, EVER! Now it tastes awful!"
15_hd,1,7.0,0.0,"Like other people have commented, this flavour and quality has really gone downhill fast. Last month I bought this and the ice cream was velvety and high quality. This month it tastes like flavoured ice shavings, there is no depth to it anymore. The peanut butter also does not have the same creaminess it once did."
15_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is by far the best ice cream Ive ever had in my life. As we all know the Haagen Dazs brand speaks for itself but flavors they have come up with exceeds the rest. There is nothing like it. And the chocolate and peanut butter just so happens to be my favorite, so I had to write a review. My only complaint is that I cannot purchase it by the gallon. Lol. Is there a Haagen Dazs rehab anyone?? Because my name is Marsha and Im addicted to chocolate and peanut butter Haagen Dazs. Lol. No really, I am. Ok, for those of you who havent tried it, you have been deprived and I need you to go buy a pint right now!! Just like Im about to do. Hehe. I hope this helps someone make their decision."
15_hd,3,2.0,1.0,"I used to love this ice cream and it always disappears in one go. But the past cooole of times, it hasnt been quite so pleasant. I dont think Im doing anything differently (I eat it all straight out of the pot, at the same speed). Lately, the peanut butter remains frozen while the chocolate use cream has softened enough for the spoon to dig in. I end up having to eat all thats around the frozen and very hard peanut butter, which mean Im not getting enough of a mix the whole way through. If it were little frozen bites of PB throughout, itd be fine. But I have this big hunk of frozen PB thats hard to break down and too salty in its own."
15_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I am a chocolate and peanut butter fanatic. I used to get the flavor at Baskin Robbins but you can’t find them anymore. Then I remembered you had the same flavor. I remember there were chicks of peanut butter throughout. Now there are slivers of peanut butter and then a frozen clump in the middle that you have a hard time breaking up in order to experience the chocolate and PB combination. The ice cream is still smooth but the PB is not. I miss the old recipe. Pleas BRING IT BACK. Especially now that we are on lockdown due to Covid-19. It would be lovely to have my favorite ice cream available.
15_hd,3,6.0,0.0,"This chocolate peanut butter recipe has functioned as my ‘therapy’ since it came out. Tired, hard day at work? Nothing a pint of Haagen dasz in bed can’t cure! But there was something dreadfully wrong with the last pint I bought. No longer rich and dense with big chunks of pb. It was soft and fluffy and sweet like any other ice cream! Please don’t change perfection!"
15_hd,1,6.0,0.0,"Its obvious that youve recently changed the recipe and its no longer delicious. The chocolate is totally different. Its lighter and more sugary tasting. It was bad when you discontinued Rocky Road, but now youve changed Chocolate and Peanut Butter!! Looks like Im going to have to find another favourite from a more reliable company."
15_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Ive been enjoying this for a couple decades, originally as Deep Chocolate Peanut Butter and the Chocolate Peanut Butter, more recently. But something is different - I still enjoy this and think it is the best ice cream on the market, but its not what it used to be. I would love to see the original Deep Chocolate return, or at least the large PB swirls Ive enjoyed - and recommended at every turn - for the last decade. Thanks for a great ice cream, but please return to one of the former recipes."
15_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I used to love this flavor. It had a darker chocolate taste that was not too sweet. And the peanut butter was in big swirls and tasted like real peanut butter. What happened? I couldn’t find any peanut butter swirls. There were some faint peanuty type stringiness in the too sweet chocolate ice cream.also- I kept looking at the ingredients because there was also a vague coconut taste. This is the 3rd time I’ve had a bad version. I’ve looked through the complaints and a lot of people have the same ones. What is going on? I don’t want A coupon . I just want the original formula back.
15_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I was super ecstatic when I found out I was going to be trying Haagen Daaz chocolate peanut butter ice cream! My favorite flavor of any brand so I like to try different brands to compare taste and textures. This was a nice quality taste and just the right amount of peanut butter. My favorite type of peanut butter in ice cream is frozen slivers of ice cream instead of the hard candy peanut butter cups. The candies make it much harder to chew because of the freezer making them hard and not as enjoyable. These peanut butter slivers were thin enough to chew making it easy on anybody regardless of the condition of their teeth. They are great frozen. The chocolate is decadent and indulging. Very easy to take in its chocolate flavor making it a perfect choice to have with the peanut butter. Another flavor option that stuck out to me while I was searching for this one in the freezer section was Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana which sounds like my next Id like to try. I only have one thing I didnt like although Im still giving 5 stars, they only make them in these small sizes. I would like to see bigger sizes so maybe Id be more likely to purchase. This will be gone in a day."
15_hd,1,4.0,0.0,"I love this flavor. But the last 4 containers were awful. Not the same taste, texture or hard peanut butter chunks. Barely any PB. For 5 bucks a pop I’m not risking purchasing this nasty new recipe. If you have changed the original version please announce the change so other hard core fans are forewarned. It is worse then cheap diary free products"
15_hd,4,2.0,0.0,"This is my favorite flavor you make, but I just had some and was a little disappointed. Did you change the recipe ?? The peanut butter was always in big chunks, but this time I could barely find any. I hope this was just a small glitch in production and not another example of a big corporation trying to squeeze more profit at the consumers expense. If you have to raise the price to make it profitable, then I say raise it. Those of us who love Haagen Dazs are willing to pay if the quality is there."
15_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"High quality chocolate ice cream with chunks and slices of flavorful peanut butter throughout. The only othe Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream comparable is Baskin Robins.m, which is very similar. Once I had Haagen Dazs I never wanted Baskin Robbins again. That’s saying something about the flavor and quality of Haagen Dazs Chocolate Peanut Butter. They put a generous amount of Peanut Butter in it, which is key in my opinion. You must have a generous portion to make it the best available."
15_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I dont eat a lot of ice cream, but when I want some my go-to is Häagen Dazs chocolate peanut butter! Its so delish! The only thing that would make it better is less chocolate and more peanut butter!! If you made a limited series called double peanut butter chocolate, Id stock up for life!"
15_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"I do not understand why they changed the recipe. Where there used to be big chunks of PB, now there are flakes...So disappointing! We used to buy a lot of this ice cream, as it was a family favorite. Well...no more! Why did they change it?"
15_hd,1,4.0,0.0,"This used to be my, and my entire familys, favorite ice cream for years......... up until this month. We buy and go through several pints per week. Then it disappeared from the shelves in January 2017. Drove more than 60 miles, and checked 10 grocery stores looking for it! Finally it returned to the shelves in early February. However, much to our dismay the recipe has changed!!!! The new peanut butter chocolate is terrible. The chocolate has barely any flavor at all, and the peanut butter ribbons are so thin (and nearly non-existent) they break when the ice cream is scooped out. This is totally different than what its been for years! And its terrible."
15_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Have always loved Peanut Butter Chocolate. However, lately, the peanut butter seems to be in very large chunks instead of being mixed in throughout the entire container. It is very hard to eat this way and you just get a mouth full of peanut butter and no chocolate ice cream. Hope its only a bad batch."
15_hd,4,3.0,0.0,First of all I absolutely love the ice cream flavor! I have purchased this brand and flavor for years! My only request is to have more peanut butter. This would make me very happy. I loveto find a nice frozen chunk of Peanyt Butter! It’s like finding a sweet treasure.
15_hd,5,2.0,0.0,My 2 kids are now as addicted as I am so we have to buy 3 pints! Unlike the other reviewers I love the huge lumps of peanut butter - I dig those out first. I think the chocolate ice cream part is not as dark as it used to be but I won’t complain. Don’t ever discontinue this - it cures my headaches and it my favorite treat. I wish I had one right now. Yum.
15_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"I adore this flavor and the only problem I ever have with it is when my grocery store doesnt have it in stock. Also, I find it hilarious that within a 30 day period, one person left a review saying there wasnt enough peanut butter and another person left a review saying there was too much. Can we just acknowledge that thats entirely a personal preference and not a fault/failing of the ice cream? Sheesh."
15_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"While I agree with others that its not the same, I would still settle for it if I could only find it. I can hardly find it anywhere anymore. Seems like you are pushing the new flavors and not distributing the CPB. Dont try to wean me off it. I love it. I live in the deep south and it is HOT down here. Please send more."
15_hd,1,7.0,1.0,Disgusting.
15_hd,2,2.0,1.0,"I eat about two pints of this a week. Its my ""go to "" dessert as I cant have gluten. The last batches I bought the peanut butter tastes the same, but the chocolate ice cream appears as if they are pumping in more air. It is softer and melts quicker. The taste is not as rich as when it was a hard texture that took longer to melt. Bring back the old formula and quit cutting corners to save money and have less ice cream per volume!"
15_hd,1,2.0,0.0,Ugh. Not the same recipe as before. Blegh. I am very disappointed.
15_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"I have loved your ice cream for the last 25 plus years, initially as deep chocolate peanut butter, as my favorite flavor. I’m so disappointed that the chunks of peanut butter are gone- the flavor profile is completely different and I no longer am able to appreciate the lovely richness of the peanut butter. Please please change it back as it was so amazing!"

15_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"My sister turned me on to this ice cream. It tastes like a peanut butter cup but in ice cream form. The major drawback for me is the peanut butter, while abundant is like concrete. Which is a challenge when the ice cream itself is pretty hard. It does have excellent flavor and high quality ingredients, and the ice cream is smooth as silk."
15_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"I buy this flavour of ice cream at least 2-3x/week for the past year and spending close to $80/month and am SO disappointed that youve cheaped out on the recipe recently with the peanut butter being way too thin and crispy now and not having enough of it. The chocolate ice cream itself also seems to somehow be lacking the deep chocolate flavour and has more of a sugary, almost processed taste to it. I hope that IF youve added any further additives, preservatives or artificial flavour that you would reflect this in your ingredient list because I am only a long time buyer based on the fact that you use an honest and chemical-free recipe. I am disappointed in changing the recipe with a clearly lesser quality product (and charging people the same amount). Please change the recipe back or youll be losing a devoted customer. Haagen Dazs should know that it targets a generally more refined-palate and health-conscious consumer so do not think this change was lost on any of us!!!!"
15_hd,1,2.0,1.0,This was the BEST ice cream... until Haagen Daz decided to change something. There was hardly any peanut butter in the last 2 containers I bought. And the chocolate ice cream seemed chalky. I hope they go back to making it how they use to m!
15_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I used to love the peanut butter chocolate ice cream. The last two times the peanut butter has had a weird texture. I don’t know if you changed the recipe or if the store is letting it melt but I’m really disappointed.

16_hd,5,59.0,0.0,"I have NEVER put ANYTHING ELSE in my mouth that tasted this good. It is stupid good. If someone told me I can only have one Vegan Junk Food item the rest of my life, this would be it. It is not junk, of course, but because it is not a Vegetable, Fruit, Legume, etc it would be considered junk food. Whoever invented this flavor deserves a Nobel Peace Prize because if Trump and Pelosi sat down together and had a bowl of this together, theyd stop fighting. Im sure of it. As a Vegan, Id give one of my lungs or kidneys to whoever invented this. But not my liver. You wouldnt want my liver. Were not on speaking terms currently. Its very hard to find good Vegan ice cream and when you do, its a spiritual experience. Thank you to whoever made this possible!"
16_hd,5,23.0,0.0,"Most people will probably buy this without realizing that its vegan, eat the entire pint in one sitting and go back to the market for more. If the marketers at H-D were smart (and after tasting this Im convinced theyre geniuses), they would do a reality-based taste test ad campaign where they asked people to identify the vegan ice cream among three samples. I guarantee most people would be hard pressed to identify the vegan from the regular stuff. This ice cream will ruin diets, start fights between roommates and make a permanent imprint on your brain. Congrats to Haagen-Dazs for cracking the code."
16_hd,5,20.0,0.0,"I happened upon this gem when I was picking up ice cream for my husband. As a celiac vegan with dairy, egg, tree-nut and several other anaphylactic allergies, there is not much I can eat treat wise without making it from scratch. I read the label multiple times thinking that I was somehow missing something. I bought it anyway and inspected the label again to ensure I had read it right- it indeed looked like it was safe for me. The chocolate salted fudge is a perfect match to my preferences as I used to love death by chocolate ice cream on the occasion I ate ice cream. I put a half of a spoonful in my mouth and was absolutely in love with the flavor. Yes, it is rich and chocolatey; however, the salted fudge truffles takes it to a whole other level! I could not stop saying amazing, every time I took a bite! My family stated that it was impossible that it could be dairy free and be so smooth and creamy. This is by far the best dairy free, nut free, gluten free vegan ice cream I have ever had! In fact it is as good as the dairy filled Haagen- Dazs I remember years ago! Thank you Haagen-Dazs for making a safe treat for those of us with food allergies. I hope to see more flavors in the future! This line is a keeper and a godsend!"
16_hd,5,17.0,1.0,"Im was so excited to try this! Im allergic to milk - not lactose intolerant- and have tried nearly every kind of non-dairy ice cream! This is by far the best Ive had.

16_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I dont normally bother to write product reviews, but this ice cream is simply outstanding. As a vegan of 10+ years, this is one of the best non-dairy ice creams I have tasted. It has a very rich, dark chocolate base with delicious salty swirls and oh my, those truffle chunks are perfect, not too hard to bite into or large. Everything is spot on, no need to add or remove anything. I appreciate keeping it fairly simple and sticking to one fudgy flavor profile. The texture is great and smooth, not watery, coconutty or gritty."
16_hd,5,3.0,0.0,This is the best non-dairy ice cream I have ever tasted. I purchased the chocolate salted fudge truffle. Each bite was exquisite the chocolate truffles were heavenly. Finally a lactose-free ice cream that I can enjoy. Thank you Haagen-Dazs!
16_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"So rich and decadent, I didn’t even believe the back when the first ingredient was water! (and the second two are sugar and corn syrup). This ice cream has no business being this creamy. It also has a nice depth and bitterness to the chocolate flavor which is made even better (if that’s possible) by the salted fudge swirl and chunks. there are no gums In it, which really gives it that melt in your mouth texture rather than the chewy gummy textures common in most dairy free desserts. I mean it when I say it has the best chocolate flavor out of any ice cream I’ve ever tried- really focuses in on that dark chocolate rather than the milk and cream like dairy frozen desserts. Haagen daaz, you nailed it!"
16_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This non dairy soy ice cream is delicious! I am lactose intolerant and havent eaten any kind of ice cream in years. I have never before tried an alternative to dairy ice cream but when I heard about this brand I decided to give it a try. After I took a bite I had to double check the ingredients list because it tasted so good and I was afraid I was eating dairy ice cream not soy ice cream. I thought it would taste different, more like fake ice cream, but it tastes so good that I couldnt even tell it was non dairy! And the best part is that it did not upset my stomach! I am so happy that I can eat ice cream again and I cant wait to go out and buy the other flavors that you offer. Thank you very much for offering a non dairy alternative for people like me who are lactose intolerant."
16_hd,5,3.0,2.0,"Ive been vegan for a while and non dairy ice cream has come a long way since I started, but its always had something missing or felt obvious that it was coconut milk. Im sick of the taste of coconut now! Every vegan desert is strongly coconut."

I would never have known it was non-dairy as it is a full flavoured and creamy as dairy based ice creams. Honestly, even if I start eating dairy again, I will keep buying this ice cream. Its so amazing."
16_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This is the best non-dairy ice cream Ive ever had. Being lactose intolerant sucks, because all the other alternatives Ive tried have some sort of weird off taste or not quite right texture. Not this stuff though. My new favorite frozen dessert. Cant wait to try the other flavors."

16_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I don’t understand how they did this. There’s no milk replacement - it’s like this is a frozen blended chocolate bar?! It’s so freaking good it makes me want to cry. I’d never guess it wasn’t regular ice cream if I didn’t know. A carton lasts me a while because it’s so rich
16_hd,4,2.0,1.0,"All I can say is thank you häagen-dazs for your revolutionary ice cream. In the past my dairy allergy had me left me in the darkness in regard to desserts, but not any more.

All that I ask is that you create a dairy free chocolate chip cookie dough flavor. Thank you for the perfection that is dairy free häagen-dazs. Peace."

16_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I am a vegan with occasional chocolate cravings. This hits the spot! Has smooth chunks of chocolate inside that melt on your tongue.
16_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Omg if ur a chocolate lover this is so good but if ur not be ready to become one!
16_hd,5,1.0,0.0,So Delectable!!!! Impeccable texture and flavor!! Mmm!!!!
17_hd,2,3.0,0.0,"I wanted to love this flavor but unfortunately it was not nearly as good as normal Häagen Dazs flavors or even some other light ice creams with 1/3 of the calories. It had no discernible caramel flavor despite being able to see little caramel ribbons. It was also much too sweet and not creamy at all. The texture was closer to a sorbet or sherbet than ice cream. Only giving it two stars for the chocolate flavor which was not artificial tasting, just too sweet."
17_hd,5,8.0,3.0,"You would never know this ice cream is light. It is delicious, smooth and creamy and has a lot of flavor."
17_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Less lactose than other regular haagendazs ice-cream?
17_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Haagen-Dazs, please dont ever change or discontinue this ice cream. It is my favorite. My local store rarely has any and when they do, I buy it all. The texture is perfect. It is unlike any other low-cal ice cream made."
17_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is fantastic. You would never know its light ice cream. Its a problem because I feel like I can eat the whole pint in one sitting. Highly recommend!
18_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"I recently went dairy free and I’ve never had much luck finding dairy free ice cream that I truly enjoyed, until now! It’s creamy like regular ice cream, and so delicious and balanced in flavor. This is top tier!"
18_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"Cant find any flavors in any of my stores anymore? I know things are hard everywhere that being said Ice Cream soothes me and I am lactose free. I did not have ice cream at all for 8 years, then dairy free started being an option! Yea! But dairy free people want lower sugar too! I love this Flavor especially, but several others are really good too. The chocolate ones are soooo chocolaty and delicious"
18_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"Bought this on a whim. It is seriously like biting into a chunk of creamy coconut, with decadent caramel swirling all around. It may be the dead of winter with over 100 cm of snow down, but this is like a mini vacation in every bite. This will be my new go to flavor! Absolutely DELICIOUS!"
18_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I love this dairy free ice cream. I especially like that it has no gums or thickeners that are in other dairy free ice creams and that causes some gastric distress. I just can’t find it in my stores anymore!! I also wish Haagen-Dazs would make a plain vanilla coconut milk based ice cream.
18_hd,5,2.0,0.0,This Ice cream taste amazing! It is hard to tell the ice cream is non dairy. The caramel tastes heavenly and the coconut flavor was not over powered at all. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients. I’m thankful Haagen-Dazs got it right!
18_hd,5,2.0,0.0,it’s so so creamy and rich and the balance in flavors is perfect. i love being able to enjoy a treat in the summer without a stomach ache!
19_hd,5,10.0,0.0,"This is utterly incredible ice cream. Ive waited for coconut for far too long, but this made it worth the wait. I was stunned to see even one negative review, and cant imagine what that person was talking about. Ive had pint after pint of this, and each one has been perfect. The only possible improvement would be a larger container."
19_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"I really loved this so much. Ill agree with others that it didnt exactly look like the picture, in that I couldnt actually see the caramel. Oh, but I could taste the hint of salty sweetness from the caramel, and the whole thing together was just a marvel in my mouth. All time favorite for me. Thank you!"
19_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"This is ice cream straight from heaven. My wife brought it home a few days ago. She ate two or three spoonfuls and gave me the rest. Shes trying to loose weight, on a diet. So I grabbed a spoon and next thing you know Im scraping the edges at the bottom wishing there was more. I should not have done that. But DANG!! Now Ive got to go buy more."
19_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"What wonderful flavors and textures- creamy, crunch, and coconut, caramel and chocolate in ever bite so no need to gerrymander the scoops! My new most favorite favorite!"
19_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"You usually have to choose between coconut and something chocolatey/caramelly, but this fabulous combo solves that problem. It is SO STUPID GOOD."
19_hd,5,4.0,0.0,My only quarrell with this product is that its almost never in stock in ny area! Probably because its flying off of the shelf!
19_hd,5,2.0,0.0,So I thought I had this ice cream thing figured out and loved the new coconut ice cream almond on a stick by Haagen Dazs but then I found the TRIO!!!!! The coconut chocolate caramel Trio layer is amazing...every bite was refreshing and delicious. My only criticism is that I ate 2/3 of the pint the first round and had a difficult time returning the remnants to the freezer. Compliments to the chef.
19_hd,5,3.0,0.0,The first bite took my breath away...each successive bite was beyond description...SIMPLY HEAVEN!
19_hd,5,3.0,1.0,coconut & chocolate ice cream is a wonderful balance. The Belgian chocolate and caramel is an added bonus.. Great combination trio!
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is my favorite ice cream. Never thought Id like coconut in an ice cream but was hooked at the first taste. The coconut is like an unexpected surprise and then the chocolate a favorite and the touch of salty carmel really sets it off. Awesome blend of flavors; cant get enough of it. Well done!!!!!!
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"It usually takes me several days to eat a carton of Haagen Dazs. I finished this carton in two days! It is simply delicious! The combination of coconut, smooth caramel and crispy Belgian chocolate, I do not have the vocabulary to express how wonderful this ice cream really is! Thank you Haagen Dazs!!"
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I am a coconut ice cream lover and this is now my favorite ice cream. My husband and I will drive to several stores just get a few pints. I am disappointed to see less stores carrying this awesome flavor. I would request this ice cream as part of my last meal on earth. I love it so much.
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I love the balance of flavors/ texture. I just wish it was easier to find - Ive noticed it is getting harder and harder to find it in normal deli places.
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Honestly, this flavor has ruined me forever. I have been unable to enjoy any other brand or flavor since i have tried this bad boy. Perfection"
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I am not a big ice cream fan but by far the best ice cream I have ever tasted. The mixture of flavors are perfect for my taste buds.
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I most definitely recommend!!!! I am absolutely in love, this is the perfect mix of flavors. Hope they never get rid of it!!!!!"
19_hd,5,2.0,1.0,My absolute favorite icecream . Thankyou. Just perfect.
19_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Finally found it in store and it is by far the best trio!
19_hd,4,1.0,0.0,wish I could find it but heard its not enough carmel
20_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"Wow! These are great! I recently discovered that I am gluten/wheat/lactose intolerant, so my world of food has shrunk dramatically! These are creamy, dreamy and decadent, much like the full dairy version! Thank you Haagen Dazs for remembering that people like me enjoy treats, too! And they are safe for my tummy! As for the two reviewers that gave this product only one star, these bars are NOT dairy products, but those ARE available for you folks...please don’t give bad reviews based on your expectations of a different product!"
20_hd,5,16.0,1.0,"I love these non-dairy ice cream bars so much. With the whole movement on vegan friendly options, this is a total hit! I can really taste the coconut and the chocolate plays a beautiful note against that the taste of caramel. Its very creamy too. It tastes just like ice cream! I am very thankful that the company came out with this friendly option for people like me that cannot have dairy. It really broadens their customer spectrum and help satisfy those that cannot have dairy with something so sinfully good. My taste buds are overjoyed by these. To those that do not like this ice cream and want the ""original,"" many grocery stores still sell the dairy ones, but for people like me, we only have a very small selection to choose from when it comes to ice cream. So I am hoping the company will come out with more choices."
20_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"Sometimes its hard finding interesting dairy/lactose free options when it comes to frozen desserts. Most stores I go to only have vanilla and chocolate dairy/lactose free ice cream so I was excited to find this at a Target. The dark chocolate is on point and the creamy inside does not make me miss dairy at all. My mom, who often thinks any nondairy alternative is just nasty, thought this was great as well. The only thing I dont like is the high sugar count but it is a dessert, after all. Ill need to stock up on these if I ever find a coupon for them!"
20_hd,5,6.0,0.0,Our family is dairy free. These are a great treat. They have a good texture and flavor. I will definitely buy these again.
20_hd,5,4.0,0.0,Weve always tried to find yummy treats that are allergy friendly and have been disappointed. The others are always gritty or just plain gross. These are creamy and delicious! Thank you for making allergy friendly treats with quality ingredients!
20_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I am dairy free and also gluten free due to having Celiac Disease for 5 years now. These are wonderful! Everything about them is delicious. Thank you Haagen Dazs! Its so nice to have delicious options when you are used to struggling to find GOOD treats and have many limitations.
20_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The best vegan ice cream I’ve ever had and wish they were being sold in all the grocery stores!
20_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Wow it was creamy. Doesn’t get better.. Good desert for healthy people
21_hd,5,27.0,0.0,"This is a tongue pleasing blend of creaminess and rich coffeeness. Not bitter at all. I love the light clean feel. It does not leave the mouth feeling ""coated"". When this ice cream melts, if it should ever get the chance to melt, it does not turn into a slurry of pithy foam. This, to me, is evidence of pure natural ice cream. Thank you Haagen Dazs."
21_hd,2,10.0,3.0,"Haagen-Dazs Coffee flavored ice cream has been my favorite ice cream for a long time. Im absolutely obsessed with it & buy a container of it every single week. Just got home from the store with my weekly tub (which is a new design, color has changed to white instead of the beige) & was unhappily surprised by what I found inside. First off there was a good inch missing from the top of the container, dug in & found it to be very soft (I usually have to chisel it out with my spoon) and more of a malt texture (or a semi firm soft serve) than a good solid ice cream, and the coffee flavor is a lot more subtle and had a vanilla like undertone to it. Not sure if the recipe has been changed with the new packaging or if I got a bad batch but Im super unhappy with my purchase today."
21_hd,1,9.0,7.0,"I have been almost addicted to your coffee ice cream for over 10 years. Last winter a new, light-colored container appeared. Appropriate, because the new coffee had barely a hint of coffee flavor. Then suddenly the good old coffee was back - but then it was gone. And then back. And then gone, and back and gone... I purchased the coffee ice cream in the old containers recently as well as the new; some were very good, some were tasteless. A question: why do you have to mess with coffee perfection and substitute something that tastes like the cardboard container???"
21_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"HD Coffee is simply the best tasting coffee ice cream available. It is not too sweet, the coffee flavor is perfectly balanced."
21_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love the taste of coffee ice cream. Ive been eating this specific flavor from Haagen-Dazs ice cream for YEARS and I still love it. If you are a person who loves coffee ice cream/ sweeter coffee, I highly recommend this! Its a bit pricier, but the quality is definitely worth it. The coffee ice cream bars covered in chocolate are the amazing as well. I rarely switch to another brand of ice cream for my coffee because Haagen-Dazs makes the best flavor I have ever tried. The taste is subtle, yet rich, and the texture is so soft and satisfying to eat!"
21_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"Underwhelmed. I must claim... DITTO! to previously posted reviews. found it to be very soft (I usually have to chisel it out with my spoon) and more of a malt texture (or a semi firm soft serve) than a good solid ice cream, and the coffee flavor is A LOT more subtle and had a vanilla like undertone to it. Not sure if the recipe has been changed or if I got a bad batch but Im super unhappy with my purchase today."
21_hd,5,5.0,1.0,"I gained about 20 pounds eating this yummy stuff every day. Finally got the weight off and now only have it once in a while, but this is the best ice cream I ever tasted. The flavor is subtle and the texture is perfect."
21_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I’m old but all my life, Haagen Dazs COFFEE ice cream has been with me. Every state, twist, turn, jobs, boyfriends, husbands, exhusbands, the most delicious constant in my life is yoooou my wonderful Coffee ice cream!! You’ve made my life better no matter what I’ve had to face. Thank you Haagen Dazs - always keep the coffee fresh and frozen!! It’s perfect! Don’t change a thing."
21_hd,5,5.0,1.0,The selected coffee has everything to do with why other coffee ice creams dont measure up. The texture is perfect. It has the perfect among of creaminess and is full of flavor.
21_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I am 60 years old and coffee ice cream was my moms favorite there was only one dairy store back then that made it. I searched and tried a lot of brands and Häagen-Dazs is by far the best coffee ice cream made. It is perfectly balanced its is just delicious!
21_hd,1,3.0,2.0,"I purchased two 14oz Haagen Dazs Coffee ice creams today (02/12/19). I was so disappointed when I got home and eat some of the Coffee ice cream and discovered it no longer taste like Coffee, it doesnt have any taste really maybe a slight hint of vanilla!!! I thought maybe I purchased a ""bad"" 14oz batch so I opened the second 14oz Haagen Dazs Coffee ice cream and it also had no Coffee flavor either!!!"
21_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I have to admit Im a coffee and ice cream snob. Id rather go without than bother with anything less than the best. Haagen-Dazs Coffee Ice Cream is the best coffee ice cream available and my favorite guilty pleasure. Love every bite!
21_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"I loved to eat this flavor when I was younger, but I really want a non-dairy version. Is there a possible time when the classic flavors will be available in non dairy options?"
21_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Hi! Im totally obsessed with your coffee ice cream, to the point that I cant stand any other brands of coffee ice cream. As I was growing up, it was my moms favorite. And now both of my children are hooked on it as well. This is one of the small joys in my life, as corny as that may sound. Im sick, all the time. Im not dying, but I have several chronic autoimmune diseases. Im always in alot of pain, and Im often sick to my stomach. As of the past few months, my body can no longer tolerate ice cream. It just makes me so, horribly nauseous. Your coffee ice cream is the only one that doesnt make me sick. The flavor is exactly right. Not too strong of a coffee flavor, but not too little of it either. On days when I can barely eat anything at all, I almost always have your coffee ice cream waiting in the freezer for me. That being said, I went to 3 different stores today in search of this ice cream. All 3 are major chain stores. All 3 stores were completely out of this coffee ice cream. Not one single pint. I ended up getting another brand & its absolutely disgusting. Anyway, I really hope I can find it soon. :-k"
21_hd,1,1.0,0.0,We used to love the coffee ice cream but now there is no creaminess or flavor. Wont waste my money again. No wonder its always on sale.
21_hd,2,1.0,0.0,Used to love it so much does not taste the same at all no flavor to the ice cream now used to buy all the time. Very disappointed.
21_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is my ***FAVORITE*** ice cream in my entire experience of eating ice cream. I wish they had it as a non-dairy flavor!
21_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best ice cream i have ever tasted. The rich coffee flavor cannot be described in words.
22_hd,3,4.0,3.0,"Could use a little stronger coffee flavor and it would be helpful if toffee was noted in the name. I didnt realize there was toffee until I tasted it in the ice cream, which Im personally not a fan of. Toffee was minimal, but good to have advertised it since its has its own characteristics."
22_hd,5,10.0,1.0,"You guys should make it in a ice cream form. Meaning, coffee ice cream with chocolate covered almonds in a carton. Similar to vanilla Swiss almond but with coffee ice cream instead! Please make it, it would be a hit! No other company has that out."
22_hd,5,5.0,0.0,This is the most diabolical ice cream bar I’ve ever had. Period. A perfect palette of coffee bean ice cream coated in chocolatey crunchy almond toffee goodness!
22_hd,5,6.0,1.0,"OMG love the crunchy clusters of almond and toffee with creamy milk chocolate that melts in your mouth. The coffee ice cream is just right and, not over bearing. I love the firmness of the ice cream and the light smooth creamy taste of the coffee ice cream one of my favorites."
22_hd,4,4.0,1.0,I purchased a box of Haagen Daz bars at the Eden Prairie Costco and noticed that some of the bars had ice cream with a mealy texture. I had to throw those bars away because they did not taste normal nor have a rich ice cream texture. Ive purchased these boxes of bars several times and never had that issue until my most recent purchase.
22_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love the coffee almond crunch. The only thing I have to complain is you don’t make the minibar anymore . My max capacity for sweet is the size of the mini. You still keep the vanilla mini, but you do away with the coffee! Please bring them back!"

23_hd,1,38.0,0.0,You took your beloved Java Chip Ice Cream and ruined its smooth rich coffee taste. You also destroyed its softer texture making it hard and unappealing. Tastes more like ice milk than ice CREAM.
23_hd,5,23.0,0.0,"A place that rhymes with Barclucks used to have an ice cream with a very similar flavor to Java Chip. It went away and coffee lovers cried, but then Haagen Dazs came out with Java Chip, and it was even better than the coffee places ice cream! Unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared from all stores, leaving us with just plain ole Haagen Dazs Coffee ice cream. I thought maybe it just disappeared in PA, but then I moved to Utah and they dont have it either (and there are LOTS of coffee lovers in Utah, contrary to popular belief). Please bring Java Chip--both big and small containers-- back to the grocery stores!"
23_hd,2,21.0,0.0,"I live for Häagen-Dazs. All of their flavors are amazing. I grew up on coffee chip, the old coffee chip from 30+ years ago. When Java chip was released I was blown away. Other than the name Java (which felt like a bit of an effort to connect to a broader audience), it was a true coffee ice cream with chocolate chip experience."
23_hd,1,14.0,0.0,"My favorite ice cream was Java Chip. In fact, not only was it my favorite, it was the only ice cream I ate. It was the only ice cream worth the calories to me. The other two members of my household liked it very much, too. Now our beloved Java Chip has been replaced with a poor substitute. The coffee taste is too strong and the texture is strange. Three thumbs down. We are so disappointed. A few years back, you got rid of the bars with the vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate coating, and now this. I guess I am not eating ice cream anymore."
23_hd,1,27.0,0.0,"Why oh why did they take my one guilty pleasure away? The Coffee Chip says ""formerly Java Chip - Improved Coffee Taste"" on the front of the carton. My heart sank when I read this cause as we all know when a company says ""new and improved"" it usually means its worse, but I bought not one but two because I had hoped it wasnt a bad change. Alas, this is just as the cartons name reads: Coffee Chip. It is NOT have Chip, nor is it an improved version of Java Chip. They cant improve upon Java Chip it was already perfect the way it was. Granted it was always semi- soft in the freezer because if the increased real coffee content was always my guess so it had to be the last thing I got at the store and then the mad dash home but it always made it and I always enjoyed it. Now sadly this was my last purchase unless they change it back."
23_hd,1,25.0,0.0,"My absolute favorite ice cream in the world was java chip, but the new coffee chip is not very good at all. I spent an insane amount of money on java chip and now ive stopped getting it at all. The safeway near me had to put in an extra row of java chip just because of me. Ive been seriously considering making a petition. I really hope it will return to the original recipe. its not necessarily terrible, but when compared to java chip it doesnt come close"
23_hd,1,10.0,0.0,"Java Chip was going to be my wedding cake flavor of choice (yes I want an ice cream cake...its possible & I dont have a partner yet but Im just trying to get ahead in the game) The new take on the ice cream is just no good and simply cannot compare, you get the slightest hint of coffee flavor and texture is off putting. Dont get me started on the new name. Just not the same. Keep the calories on! This was more than a flavor to me, it was comfort, happiness, and nothing but a joyful experience to have. Please reconsider going back!"

23_hd,1,13.0,0.0,September 2019: I just bought the Java Chip ice cream which I have had numerous times before this. I noticed the rich ice cream taste is GONE. It now tasets like ice milk. Thats it for me--no longer going to buy this one.

23_hd,1,9.0,0.0,You made a big mistake changing Java Chip to Coffee Chip. Java Chip had bold coffee flavor. But Coffee Chip tastes flat- like so many other flavorless coffee ice cream brands sold in the market
23_hd,5,5.0,1.0,"Ben & Jerrys has several really good coffee ice cream flavors but this flavor is my personal favorite among the coffee flavors. Java Chip takes haagen dazs regular coffee flavor and adds in chocolate bits. The combination of the coffee ice cream and chocolate is amazing. I am also perplexed as to why most stores dont sell it - the regular coffee flavor, which is great, is super popular and I would think most fans of that would love the chocolate added into it. Highly recommended if you love coffee ice cream!!"
23_hd,2,5.0,0.0,"I spent months looking for Java Chip and not finding it, not knowing it had been discontinued and this flavor, Coffee Chip, took its place. Coffee Chips flavor is ok, kind of flat compared to the Java Chip. The container states its the same as Java Chip but with improved coffee flavor. No. Its actually bland and I wouldnt buy it again. They need to go back to the original Java Chip formula. Disappointed."
23_hd,1,7.0,0.0,"Java Chip was my absolute favorite ice cream. Then it disappeared, and you didnt know why? Now it has been replaced with Coffee Chip, with ""improved coffee taste""? Um, no.

23_hd,3,6.0,0.0,"Sorry - love several flavors of Haagen-Dazs but the new and improved Coffee Chip is no where near the wonderful flavor and smoothness of Java Chip.

23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,Youre Java Chip has kept me sane through COVID 19. When I went to the grocery store to replenish my stock I was horrified to see that there was Coffee Chip instead of Java Chip. My heart sank. It read better taste! WRONG!!!! It was actually perfect and now its ruined. It actually has less coffee flavor and the wonderful creaminess is gone gone gone. Who approved this... Probably the bean counters not the bean tasters!!! Bring back the old formula!!! Please!!!
23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,I’m so upset by the new coffee chip flavor! Java chip was the best favor ever- why would you ruin such an amazing flavor! My whole family is so upset- it is a totally new flavor not just a rebrand. Java chip was a delightfully creamy consistency with thick chocolate chunk chips and now coffee chip is a shotty tasting icey faux coffee flavor with terrible chocolate chips!! I’m SO UPSET- that this is the first review of a product I’ve ever written in my life.
23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"Java Chip has been the favorite ice cream of my family for over a decade, so we immediately noticed the difference with Coffee Chip. It is less flavorful, less creamy, and overall just a toned-down version of Java Chip. When I first tasted it, I thought it was a freezing mistake because I could not believe these changes were not made in error. This ice cream is strictly worse - please, please, PLEASE bring back Java Chip. - a longtime dedicated fan"
23_hd,1,6.0,0.0,What a shame to lose my favorite ice cream. The taste and creaminess of java chip is no longer there with coffee chip. Please bring it back.
23_hd,5,5.0,1.0,"I Love coffee and chocolate and this flavor is teh perfect combination of both!! There are many versions out there of Java chip ice creams but Haagen-Dazs is by far my Favorite!! The flavor is rich, creamy and soft! The only problem is that is so hard to find, please Haagen-Dazs stock it in more stores just like the other flavors, this should be a basic to have it in the supermarkets Im sure it will be more popular. LOVE!!!"
23_hd,5,7.0,1.0,I have only one (huge) complaint regarding Java Chip. No stores in my area stock it. When Starbucks discontinued its ice cream I turned to this and it didnt disappoint. The combination of coffee flavor with the chips was incredible. I just wish I could find some around here.
23_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I’m torn to rate this because my family absolutely loves this ice cream, but we can never find it. It’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever experienced. When it comes to flavor this is a million stars, but when it comes to supply and demand it’s in the negatives. Come on Haagen, give the people what they want!"
23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,I just bought and tried the new Coffee Chip replacement for the Java Chip and I agree with the other reviews. Lacks all the wonderful components that made Java Chip so delicious. Too bad my grocery market is not accepting returns now do to the pandemic or I would return this immediately. I am not sure what to do with the 2 pints I bought. Please bring Java Chip back to us that truly loved this product.
23_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Loved the Java Chip. Saw this has replace it so I tried it. The flavor is not as bold and the texture is harder. I am not sure who you guys got in your focus group or taste group that got you to change the flavor! It is not ""improved"" to my taste buds. I think if it is not changed back I can let Haagen-Dazs coffee ice cream stay on the shelf in the store. Hate you guys changed this. Kert"
23_hd,1,4.0,0.0,The new coffee chip just take plain like the rest of the ice cream brands. It gets freezer burned in the freezer a lot easier and just doesn’t taste as good. Go back to the old Java Chip. That one was amazing!
23_hd,3,4.0,0.0,"I miss Java Chip, this doesn’t compare. But what would really be ideal is if they could bring back Espresso Cookie Crumble. Please Haagen!"
23_hd,2,3.0,0.0,I loved Java Chip. I dont like as much the new Coffee Chip. The texture was smoother and tasted more like a strong coffee than a weakened taste of coffee. I prefer Java Chip over Coffee Chip. Will you bring Java Chip recipe back I preferred it. It had a unique coffee flavor than just plain coffee.
23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"This is the new version of Java chip. In my opinion, It tastes nothing like the original. I feel like they took leftover coffee ice cream and shoved chips of coffee flavored bits in it in the hopes of saving money while fooling people."
23_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Taste is subjective but Im not tasting the ""improved"". Coffee Chip tastes fine but Java Chip was perfect. Why pay a premium price for fine? Btw, Starbucks sells coffee in paper cups. How are they the benchmark for good coffee?"
23_hd,2,3.0,0.0,Coffee Chip is markedly blander than Java Chip. I know your marketing claims that it is “bolder” but that is just Orwellian doublespeak. Bring back Java Chip!
23_hd,2,3.0,0.0,"I think the coffee in Java Chip was richer and higher grade. Just opened my first and probably my last carton, noticed the difference immediately."
23_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"Terrible choice to change perfect Java Chip - to ordinary coffee with chips. ""If it aint broke, dont fix it""."
23_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"This ice cream is ok. Does not taste the same as Java Chip. There was something different, more flavorful, and better about Java Chip. This one tastes exactly the same as the plain coffee but with chips added. It is more bland and mild, but still has the coffee flavor. Bring back Java chip please. It was the best."
23_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"I love Java Chip Haagen-dazs so much! Since I was a kid, my dad and I would share a pint or my sister and I would demolish one each - it is creamy and tastes like the best coffee ice cream ever (also Haagen-dazs) but with the most perfectly sized, dense little chocolate pieces. I look for it every time I go to the store but can never find it in any grocery store :( One time my sister found it on Go Puff but I havent been very lucky! Please tell me where I can find it!"
23_hd,4,2.0,0.0,Change the name back it’s hard to find with this name and stock the stores with more of it. I don’t know if you changed anything but it tastes like you did so please change back and lastly please lower the price because I would buy so much more and I know lots of people that would do the same
23_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Well...for as long as I can remember, Haagen-Dazs has always been my preference for ice cream. What distinguishes its flavors from others, truly boils down to the quality and speciality of ingredients. Coffee and chocolate are simply soulmate pairings for the taste buds and the richness in the flavor has a sort of perpetual impression with every bite. Youll soon find that you cannot get enough of this ice cream, as its arguably one of Haagen-Dazs best flavors."
23_hd,1,2.0,0.0,I am devastated! The only ice cream in the world I would eat is Java Chip. It had a creamy texture that delighted me like none other. The regular coffee icecream is too thick and hard. Java was a truly unique flavor. Please bring it back! Off to find a replacement somewhere . . .
23_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Im not sure what everyone is talking about, I just bought the Java Chip ice cream for the first time today and its delicious! My supermarket in PA didnt have anything but Java Chip. Maybe its being discontinued. I hope not because this flavor is amazing!"
23_hd,2,2.0,0.0,Please bring back JAVA CHIP!!!! Coffee chip is definitely notably different and the new “stronger coffee taste” just is not as good of ice cream .... :( the java ice cream taste was better and less artificial tasting
23_hd,3,2.0,0.0,"Why in the world would you replace the most amazing ice cream ever produced (Java Chip), for one that is simply meh (Coffee Chip)??? The marketing team at Haagan-daz should be fired!! What were you thinking??"
23_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I love using this flavor for a milkshake. Simple coffee flavor with some chocolate chunks. However, its been at least a couple years since Ive been able to find this in grocery stores."
23_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"I love this flavor but can never find it! After Howard Johnsons went out if business along with their FANTASTIC Mocha chip flavor, I turned to Starbucks Java chip, now thats gone so I turned to Haagendazs Java chip and cant find it hardly ever! PLEASE stock it in Publix or Walmart."
23_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"please do not include ""natural flavors."" We the consumer, do not trust this vague label but do trust in your product, the transparency and ingredients. There are tons of articles online about the range of possibilities ""natural flavors"" can be and people not consuming products with this labeling. I personally stick to only your coffee and chocolate flavors because as of now, they do not contain ""natural flavors."""
23_hd,3,2.0,0.0,Definitely not improved- it more similar to the regular coffee with added chips - I liked java chip because it was different.
23_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"The older version “Java chip” was so smooth and creamy. The new version is the complete opposite. The ice cream is harder to scoop through and it tastes watered down. So disappointed in this new version, wish they would have stuck with the original Java Chip."
23_hd,4,1.0,0.0,I came here to find out what happened to the java chip. We loved it and now can only find the coffe chip which is not even close. Did you discontinue it?
23_hd,1,1.0,0.0,Coffee chip is sooo disappointing. It doesn’t even compare to Java chip!! I’ve been eating Java chip for years. BRING BACK JAVA CHIP PLEASE!!
23_hd,3,1.0,0.0,not nearly as good as Java Chip..Bring back Java Chip
24_hd,5,15.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite flavor. I love coffee ice cream and I love chocolate (but I dont like chocolate ice cream), so I was excited to try this. It really works! I was worried that the vanilla ice cream would water down the coffee flavor, but I dont think it does. The chocolate layer is awesome! In case you were wondering what ""crispy chocolate"" is, its like the coating on a chocolate covered ice cream bar. Its thinner than the bits you find in chocolate chip ice cream. It has a satisying crunch and a rich chocolate taste. Im going to be looking for this flavor everywhere I go."
24_hd,5,8.0,0.0,"I never write reviews but I have to, Please dont discontinue this flavor, I am the kind of person who never tries new flavor, I stick with original Strawberry Vanilla or Pineapple Coconut flavor, because new flavors always disappoints me when I go home. So I am so glad I tried this because I love coffee, and its not too sweet usually when you add chocolate into ice cream it become sickening sweet, but it is the PERFECT BALANCE of flavor here. I need this every week now. I am sooooo hooked"
24_hd,4,2.0,1.0,"This was the first Häagen-Dazs Trio I purchased. I LOVE Coffee and Dark Chocolate, so I was anxious to try it. I went to the freezer and the ice cream was GONE!!!!! I had to wait for several weeks before someone found it in the stores again. Maybe all of that waiting made my expectations grow and grow. I found the flavor mild in coffee taste. The quality of the ice cream was excellent! It was rich, creamy, smooth. I also would have liked more Dark Chocolate Pieces."
24_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"I was obsessed with this ice cream a couple of years ago but then it disappeared and Ive been looking for it ever since, I finally saw it today so I bought a few worried it would sell out. Went home and tried it to then be extremely disappointed. I opened two of the containers and both were not the creamy ice cream texture expected. I dont know what happened, if this is just how it is now but Im so so sad about it. Please fix this!!"
24_hd,4,2.0,0.0,"I love Haagen-Dazs coffee ice cream, but when I saw this Trio, I had to try it. It did not disappoint; it is a wonderful combination. The only reason Im giving it a 4 instead of 5 star rating is that there is so much of the crunchy chocolate layers that it overshadows the ice cream and becomes more of a chocolate ""dish"" with some ice cream. But, thats just me. Im sure many people will love it. And, Ill surely buy it again."
24_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is so good, Im actually taking the time to review it, I loved the flavor so much. The blend of coffee in vanilla is in the perfect ratio, and mix well without overpowering each other. I bought one the other day to try, and dug around and ate the chocolate layers first, and then I was treated with the delicious vanilla coffee. This pint didnt last long. Husband was also impressed. Usually our go-to is Vanilla Swiss almond. Ill be buying some of these too."
24_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Whoever came up with the idea for this flavor has changed the world of ice cream for me. As a tiny person who generally doesnt like sweets, I never thought I could eat a whole carton of ice cream in one sitting. But one day when Publix was BOGO, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone of my usual dulce de leche flavor and I thought I could give this one a try. This one flavor has made the impossible become possible. I finished it all. In one sitting. From the first spoonful of crunchy Belgian chocolate goodness to my last, all my worries temporarily melted away as I enjoyed every moment of this flavor. As a busy millennial, I never take time to post reviews but I had to for this. (I might have also wanted to look at the picture of the ice cream to satisfy my cravings until I have time and money to get more...) Please never stop making this flavor."
24_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"Like the other review, like eating snow. Nothing but crystals. Very weak barely there flavor. I might actually return it to store, it was that bad."
24_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I was looking forward to the creamy texture from the regular vanilla and chocolate flavors but this new trio did not deliver. The icy texture of the new trio was a big disappointment...I so wanted the creaminess that I’m use to. The flavor was fairly mild but I did love the chocolate crunchiness. If you like ice milk then this new trio is for you. I will not buy this product again.
24_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"I think theres something wrong with this recipe. The coffee and vanilla ice creams are very light in flavor and almost watery. The texture is also a little off, maybe almost icy. The chocolate is fine, but I eat HD coffee all the time and the coffee in here doesnt taste the same"
24_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Honestly I’m in love with this ice cream and definitely recommend it. It’s crispy layer of chocolate is just something out of this world. Definitely something you should try if you have not.
24_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love this icecream it is so decadent yet it has a nice chocolately crunch. It is absolutely my favorite icecream of all time just wish I could find it in more stores.
24_hd,5,2.0,1.0,What can be better than coffee and vanilla ice cream layered with delicious crisp Belgian chocolate in every bite. Fabulous. A great find. I cant wait to have some more
24_hd,5,1.0,0.0,the best combination of ice cream I have ever had. Now I can just buy one and get all three of my favorite flavors. Its the best indulgence in the ice cream section.
24_hd,1,2.0,1.0,Have to say this isn’t their best. It’s very ‘watered’ down tasting and not enough coffee flavor. On to the next...
24_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I just finished trying my first TRIO and found I had bought a DOU. Very disappointing.
25_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I have been sad ever since the Espresso Cookie Crumble flavor was discontinued, and while this doesnt replace it, it certainly reminds me of it and makes me glad to have a coffee ice cream again! I wasnt sure with my first bite, because it definitely doesnt have that overly-sweet taste that most ice creams do. But after 2 bites, I was sold. I really like the sharpness of the espresso coming through, and the fact that it doesnt coat my tongue with sugar. Really, really satisfying ice cream!"
25_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite! Coffee flavor is excellent and the chips are perfect. The taste and texture are just right for me. I don’t like a heavy, fatty ice cream so this is perfect for me. So glad to have a delicious coffee flavor with great taste and low calories. There are also 9g of protein per serving. Excellent all around!"
25_hd,1,2.0,1.0,I purchased this item because Kroger was out of Haagen-dazs coffee ice cream. This one disappointed. The coffee flavor is non detectable and the espresso chips leave a bitter unpleasant aftertaste. The ice cream was not creamy very bland.
25_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Coffee is life for my boyfriend and I. We drink straight up black coffee on daily basis and this is by far one of the best coffee flavor we have tried! Please do not discontinue this!
26_hd,5,10.0,0.0,SPEECHLESS! Fantastic. Couldnt be better. Its the ice-cream youd eat 24/7!
26_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"If vanillas out of stock, Ill grab this one instead."
26_hd,5,13.0,3.0,"The taste is amazing, enough cookies and enough cream. I love it, Ive had it once and I immediately fell in love and had it almost every day in the summer."
26_hd,5,10.0,2.0,I love the Cookies & Cream flavor! Its so rich and creamy! Its the best Cookies & Cream Ive tried!
26_hd,4,6.0,2.0,"Classic flavor. Perfect Haagen Daz-y creaminess weve all come to expect. I want it to be the best cookies and cream Ive had but I cant say that it is since there is always an underwhelming amount of chocolate wafer cookie. But outside of small batch local shops, Haagen Dazs version of this flavor has no trouble blowing away any grocery store competition."
26_hd,5,4.0,1.0,Love it great flavour! Great creaminess!
26_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Great flavor! The cookies are uniquely good! I was trying to find out who made the cookies.
26_hd,5,5.0,3.0,Ive missed this flavor so much. One of my Favorite flavors EVER!
27_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"I used to like the chocolate chocolate chip (CCC) ice cream, until I met the Belgian chocolate (BC). In contrast to a mixture of strong textural difference in CCC, where you got smooth ice cream and the firm chips in one bite, BC is super smooth and way creamier than the chocolate ice cream in CCC. The chocolate flavor is much stronger and the silky texture is just unstoppable. I also love that theres a hint of bitterness in BC instead of plain sweetness, giving more depth to the flavors. In summary, I fell in love at first spoon and stick to it ever since. Best chocolate ice cream on the market, no doubt! Sorry, CCC!"
27_hd,5,5.0,2.0,"I love chocolate, but I have never liked chocolate ice cream. I’m so glad I tried the Belgian Chocolate ice cream though because it is incredible!! I love to have a bowl with half Belgian Chocolate and half Strawberry. Best combination! The only problem with this flavor is that it’s very difficult to find. I used to be able to find at one store before I moved in May, and now I haven’t been able to find it anywhere! I looked it up tonight and it seems like they may have rebranded it as part of the “destination series,” and apparently my local Target should have it now. Fingers crossed they actually do!"
27_hd,5,34.0,3.0,"This Ice Cream was so freaking good I googled it to just find out about it, who does that? I have never in my 58 years tasted a Chocolate ice cream this good......Im a chocolate addict and have been all my life......I can only imagine if one dies and goes to Heaven and asks for Chocolate Ice Cream it would have a hard time competing with Haagan Dazs Belgium Chocolate."
27_hd,5,4.0,1.0,Get it....Its so good. I will buy it for you if you dont like it. The texture is soooooo good and the the flavor is a perfect balance and not too sweet. Its a perfect balance of dark chocolate flavor shavings mixed within the chocolate icecream. I like dark chocolate much better than milk. Not sure what this is considered. But its amazing.
27_hd,5,5.0,3.0,"Stole me from a large competitor, who had me hooked on one of their flavors. My husband went to the store one night to get me my favorite. However, the store was out. My husband bought me Haagen-Dazs Belgian Chocolate. I was disappointed, I almost wished he just didnt get anything. One spoonful and I became an instant convert. This was quality ice cream that satisfied my mouth!!!!"
27_hd,5,3.0,1.0,This ice cream flavor is truly the best of Haagen Dazs! The finely shaved pieces of dark chocolate melt in your mouth along with the decadent chocolate ice cream... this ice cream is definitely for dark chocolate lovers on a hot summer day. I can easily finish a tub. Its definitely not too sickly sweet that some ice cream can get. Very rich and smooth!
27_hd,2,1.0,0.0,Tastes much less substantial and creamy than it used to: the recipe has to have changed just like the vanilla. I also weighed this on a food scale and there’s nowhere close to the mass of ice cream it says there is in the nutritional content: Will not be buying Haagen daze anymore
27_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"Too bad it’s not always available , I can go months not finding it in stores . Please make it a regularly available flavor , big fan !"
27_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best ice cream flavor ever. Omg. So so good. There is no chocolate ice cream this good.
27_hd,5,1.0,0.0,A chocolate experience that you wont want to miss.
27_hd,5,1.0,0.0,No contest - BEST - chocolate ice cream on earth!
28_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I love the dulce de leche that used to come as a bar, but it went away.....then came this....if you are thinking cookie, its more like a brownie which is awesome! The chocolate coating is the same as the bar was (a little heavy in my opinion, but my daughter loves that most of all). The ice cream is its usual perfect dulce de leche, same as you get in the carton. If its too soft you may want to check your freezer setting."
28_hd,2,3.0,1.0,"I agree with other reviewers - the taste of the chocolate cookie at the bottom overpowered the dulce de leche and rendered it virtually non-existent, yet somehow too sweet. Perhaps a vanilla or caramel-flavored cookie at the bottom would have accentuated the dulce de leche flavor. I want to think that the plain vanilla bar is less intense but Im a little hesitant to try it. I love Haagen Dazs products, especially the ice cream bars, but unfortunately this just didnt do it for me."
28_hd,2,3.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream is dulce de leche. When i seen this bar i was happy but when i took a bite i was upset i couldnt really taste the ice cream. Why not add caramel in the middle see what taste it would give it
29_hd,5,6.0,1.0,"As an avid ice cream eater I am very picky in the ice cream I eat and I have to say this is now my favorite ice cream. As soon as you open the container you can see a nice swirl of carcamel and get the sweet aroma of the dulce de leave that is very appealing. In each scoop you get a nice amount of caramel and the texture was so smooth, creamy and rich. I also like that you can put so many different topping with this like pretzels, chocolate sauce, strawberry, it just a very universal icecream that you can really get in to suit your cravings. The only issue I had is I wish they made a bigger size because I basically inhaled it after my first bowl."
29_hd,4,3.0,0.0,"Love Haagen-Dazs, the Dulce De Leche is a great flavor. The caramel isn’t super sweet, which is great, and it’s smooth ( not gritty ). The ice cream is soft, and smooth. Love that this flavor was easy to find, and is sold at my local stores. Will be definitely buying this flavor in the future."
29_hd,5,4.0,2.0,"I got this Haagen-dasz Ice Cream days ago, we already tried it and I like it, it is creamy, it has a good flavor, I only didnt like the size, I would love a bigger one and it was a little hard to find it, definitely I will try other flavors of this good brand."
29_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I am a huge caramel fan and this flavor hits every area for me. Ive tried almost every other kind of caramel ice cream that I can find from Edys, Blue Bell, Ben & Jerrys, and others and none of them compare to Haagen-dazs version. I do wish this flavor was easier to find. At one time I saw a bigger size at our local Wal-mart (which I quickly bought) but havent seen it since. Also the last couple of pints that Ive purchased have had some quality control issues either with the manufacturing or the transportation to the vendor. Either way, the ice cream is incredibly creamy and the caramel swirls in the ice cream has to be made of some kind of baby angel dust because its unbelievable. If you like caramel, this is your ice cream for life."
29_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"This is one of the richest, creamiest Ice creams I have ever had. My spoon practically glides through it like butter. Full of caramel ribbons and filled with flavor this is a new favorite. I will be staying up after my kids sleep to enjoy this in peace. It is on the higher end price wise, but totally worth indulging every once in awhile. Only thing that kept this from 5 stars."
29_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I love caramel and this ice cream does not dissapoint. It is very creamy with swirls of real caramel all though it. I also love that the ingredients are all natural. This one is a favorite of mine!
29_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I like the caramel taste I can’t find another brand that’s equal to this. The only disappointment is that it only comes in 14oz :-( & it’s hard to find in stores.
29_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I love this Dulce de Leche ice cream. The texture is smooth and creamy, just the way you want an indulgent ice cream to be. The flavor is delicious without being too much. This is an ice cream I won’t share with my kids!"
29_hd,4,1.0,0.0,The Dulce de Leche by Haagen-dazs is delicious! It is very rich and creamy. It has a great combination of caramel and vanilla. Im a huge caramel fan and this has the perfect caramel taste for ice cream. Everyone in my family loves it and it doesnt last very long when I get it!
29_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is to die for! Rich and creamy with high quality ingredients that make all the difference. Every single bite is so sinfully delicious. It’s easy to eat an entire container in one sitting!
30_hd,5,15.0,1.0,Im a huge green tea fan and the second I found out my favorite ice cream brand had it as a flavor I went looking. Could only find it at my favorite grocery store! Finally I found it at target and it was on sale too!! This ice cream is just wonderful! Matcha flavor could be a little stronger but I am so pleased. The texture is downright amazing! Smooth and velvety creamy. Best texture they have produced IMO. Dont know how you did it but its perfect! Leaves me wanting more...which means Ill be going to the store often haha. Definitely needs to be BIGGER! Super tasty!! Spread the news of this tasty treat all over my social media accounts
30_hd,5,9.0,1.0,"The absolute best ice cream I’ve ever tasted. Just perfect. I literally buy out all of the stores in my area that carry the flavor which aren’t a lot sadly. If I can’t buy them all I hide the ones left behind another ice cream. I just got back from the store right now and was wondering if I could buy in bulk and decided to right a review. So ten stars from me. Definitely a good choice unless you’re in My town trying to get it from my stores, if that’s the case then it’s disgusting STAY AWAY!!! ;^)"
30_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"I love this green tea ice cream! A really good one though is hard to find! Either it’s grainy or not strong enough or way too sweet! THIS IS PERFECT !!! And to find it on sale at Target was a bonus!!! Perfect texture, not too sweet and wonderful Matcha flavor!! Buy this if you find it!!! You won’t regret it!"
30_hd,4,10.0,1.0,"I absolutely love this ice cream, it is hands down my absolute favourite of any brand and flavour. The texture is amazing and its nice and creamy. However, I wish the flavour was a little stronger, after a few spoonfuls, unless I eat it super slowly, my mouth is so cold I can barely taste the flavour. When my friend tasted it, she said it kinda tasted like vanilla. You can see a lot of other people love this flavour, and although a lot of others agree the flavour isnt as strong as preferred, it is still amazing. I also wish it was slightly cheaper for the size it comes."
30_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"Ive tried tons of Matcha flavored ice cream but this is probably my favorite ever. The flavor is absolutely divine, It doesnt taste too sweet or artificial. The matcha is just right, though im the type that likes my pastries or drinks with matcha to have a lot in it, but I think for people wanting to try out matcha for the first time to try this out ice cream first. Its so creamy, the look of the ice cream is lovely and smooth. When tasting it, it lightly coats your tongue, the cream itself has such a great texture, Its perfect for a hot day or staying home listening to the rain or snow hit your window. So so so so good <3 Ive bought at least 12 pints since i discovered it last spring."
30_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I came across this new ice cream flavor at the store. I was skeptical, since many brands have green tea ice cream, but they are not good at all. Either they are too sweet or they just doesnt taste like green tea. I decided to give it a try and really like it. The ice cream is not too sweet and has a slight flavor of green tea. In my opinion, the green tea flavor can increase a little bit more, then it would be perfect. As of now, this is the best green tea ice cream I have had, except the ones I get at the Japanese restaurants."
30_hd,5,5.0,2.0,This is beyond life changing!! Not overly sweet but perfectly creamy! Plan on buying everything “green tea” related from now!! Hope they keep this forever and ever!
30_hd,3,3.0,1.0,"I really enjoy eating Haagen-Dazs ice cream. I was really excited when I found out that there is a green tea flavor. I was looking for that authentic green tea flavor taste, or something similar to where I could actually taste the green tea. The texture, ingredients, and taste are great, but I really wish it had a stronger green tea flavor. If there was a stronger green tea flavor I definitely think more people would buy this ice cream. I have yet to find a brand that has perfected the green tea taste that asian restaurants serve."
30_hd,4,3.0,0.0,"this is one of the best green tea ice creams I have every tried, BUT I would definitely be completely in love with it if it had a bit more of the green tea flavor. I thoroughly enjoy it, It is my next favorite running a close second to your Caramel Cone!"
30_hd,4,5.0,1.0,"My elderly mother loves your Green Tea Ice Cream.. She has hypertension, high cholesterol, and suffers from constipation. We know that green tea contains caffeeine, how much caffeine is in a cup (8oz) serving of your green tea ice cream?"
30_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Please never stop making this...I promise to eat this even if I turn 80! I love the fact that there are only five simple ingredients and no inconspicuous natural ingredients. You use real Matcha green tea, which is so delicious."
30_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I recently found this in local store and had to try it as a huge fan of green tea anything. I can see where some people might be disappointed, but I myself was not. It is very hard to find anything in my area such as green tea ice cream. I am so happy to have it on my local store shelf and will continue to buy it two at a time. THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT!"
30_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I am OBSESSED with this and I’m on a hunt to buy it in a large amount but so far no luck .. and I can only buy it at target.. PLZZZZZZ never stop making it or ill be sooo sad .. I buy like 3 at a time !! It’s a creamy sweet dream of green tea and I annoy get enough !!! I am not a fan of ice cream so this is a huge deal lol.
30_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"The texture and quality of Haagan-Dazs is excellent and if it were organic, it would be the best grocery store ice cream, period. I love green tea, matcha especially, but this flavor is too subtle. Make it a little stronger and it will be great."
30_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I dont know what these other people giving bad reviews are talking about. This ice cream is awesome. I buy it 3 at a time. If its not enough green tea flavor brew yourself a cup. Ill take a whole truck load of this thank you very much.
30_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"I love you, Haagen-Dazs. Please do not think that I have any problem with your ice cream, I LOVE it. I love that I can pronounce all of your ingredients. I wish there was more matcha green tea in this ice cream though. Its too subtle."

When our local supermarket sells out, we scour the city to find it. When eating this delicious concoction, each spoonful is like a experiencing this tasteful treat for the very first time over and over again. WE LOVE THIS ICE CREAM. Please keep this flavor as a staple of the Decadence collection. Years ago, we fell in love with another flavor, Coffee Toffee Crunch, but you discontinued it. Please don’t let the same happen with Honey Salted Caramel Almond."
31_hd,5,11.0,0.0,Picked this up a few days ago on a whim at my local Wal-mart. Figured it would be something different(love me some chocolate. But just feel the market can be so saturated with chocolate ice creams at times. Or includes chocolate pieces. So good to have a change on the shelf) to give a try. And boy was I right. Im not a big honey fan but how it was mixed with the pinch of salt in the caramel. Totally made this a really awesome flavor. Not to mention that the almonds were evenly layered throughout to add a nice crunch to break up so much of the sweet factor too. I will for sure come back to this flavor again.
31_hd,5,13.0,0.0,"As usual, Haagen Daz creates something so incredible and so sinfully good, its cost me a friendship. Currently training for some races and body building. I committed to our workout group (consisting of a strict diet plan)... until I ran into this. Put it this was, Ive already eaten a total of 7 pints. I got caught at a local store buying two pints. Sadly, it was someone with part of the crew."
31_hd,5,8.0,0.0,"For the past 2 years my go to Haagen Dazs flavor has been Pineapple Coconut...but I may have a new favorite. The only problem is, no one stocks it! Please start stocking this everywhere! I can find the 3oz minis but that just isnt enough!!!"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I brought this by mistake and every since then its all I can think about eating. I brought 6 pints one day and I went back the next and it was all gone. My spirit was crushed. The way the flavors come together, the smooth caramel, the honey, the hint of salt, and the creamy vanilla....heaven!"
31_hd,5,8.0,0.0,I hunted 5 different grocery stores for this flavor. When I do I get more pints no matter if on sale or not. Love the light and salty flavor of the smooth ice cream. Gooey valleys of caramel with crunch almonds that provide the full balance of what I look for in ice cream.
31_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"This ice cream flavor is so ""decadent"". It contains every single ingredient I LOVE. The combined taste of honey, salted caramel, and almond is seductively addictive. I just cannot get enough of its creamy lightly salted texture, and then the crunch of the almonds is pure heaven on earth. I eat it so quickly, who has time for a photo."
31_hd,5,7.0,0.0,I am a lover of another brand of ice cream. I tried this flavor and have completely switched allegiance. It is the best I have ever eaten.
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I can’t find this size (14oz) in stores and I am in Central Florida. I can only find the small 3 ounce cups. Soooo gooood
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I live in NYC. I have the telephone numbers of ALL the Supermarkets and Bodegas within a 6 block radius that I bought Honey Salted Caramel Ice Cream from. I even know the delivery days that the Haagen Dazs truck comes to make their drop offs! Ive given my number to 1 of the Supermarket managers and he made me a promise that hell save a case for me because WHENEVER I find this DELECTABLE, SINFUL & SCRUMPTIOUS ice cream in ANY store...I BUY THEM ALLLLLL!! Ive NEVER tasted ANYTHING IN MY LIFE THAT HAS GIVEN ME SUCH PLEASURE! WHATEVER you do PLEASE DONT change the recipe! Its PERFECT JUST THE WAY IT IS! Ive told any and everyone I know about this flavor! You should carry these in the quart size and put them in EVERY store that sells HAAGEN DAZS!"
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Both my wife and I agree that the Honey Salted Caramel Almond is such a unique and delicious flavor that we have become addicted to it. But now now I cant seem to find it anywhere. I keep trying online grocery delivery options which we have to do by necessity these days but this flavor is missing from the assortment at Frys or Walmart where they used to stock it before. Please please please have this available soon and please carry this flavor forever! During these days of lockdown at home, this would be a perfect pleasure treat"
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I have literally never written a product review for anything before, but I love this ice cream so much that I had to find somewhere to express it! Haagen Dazs, you have me HOOKED on the Honey Salted Caramel Almond Ice Cream. I have been without it for months now, as my neighborhood grocery store stopped keeping it stock for some reason. I just found it today way in another town miles from my home, and it has been the highlight of my evening. This flavor is so good that I have force myself to stop mid-pint. I can literally finish the whole thing in one sitting, no problem! It has the perfect blend of almonds and honey."
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I am not normally hooked on ice cream for periods of time;however, this flavor changed all of that!!! Thought I’d eat a few bites and keep going back now and then but there was no stopping and my carton was empty soon after. I love this flavor and it’s the only ice cream I want. My family can’t believe how I keep talking about and searching for it at several grocery stores — my store needs to re-stock!!!!! Great recipe"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This was the BEST ice cream I have ever had... but it is only made in the small containers, which sucks because of how delicious it is!!!! I literally eat a two small containers EVERY night. I would HIGHLY recommend trying it!!! Hopefully they start carrying it in a large container soon!!!! Seriously the best ice cream I’ve ever had!!"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This flavor competes for a top spot with my favorite classics. If youve ever had salted honeycomb overseas, this is one of the closest flavors youll find to it. The almonds are a nice touch and the salt is just right. Its delicious. You can eat it straight out the tub, just try not to eat it all!"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Like others, I want to eat this honey salted caramel almond magic every day. I don’t even want other flavors now, they just don’t seem worth eating. Seriously, the one store I know of that sells this flavor is going to stop and I don’t know if I’ll ever eat ice cream again now."
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Oh my goodness this pairing of honey, caramel, salt, and almonds are PERFECTLY delicious. It is so very satisfying. Warning: this ice cream combo will create an addiction to want and need more! Dont be turned off by the honey in the name or ingredient list- you gotta try it!"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This is a phenomenally delicious ice cream. It kind of takes ice cream to a different level; something I might not have thought possible. As much as any food can be, it’s transcendent. HD, please always make and make available this flavor in the current version!"
31_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I found this ice cream at my local Food Lion grocery store and tried it on a whim. OMG!!! This is the BEST ice cream ever. Every time I go to the grocery store, I have to stock up. It is that good."
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Honestly I discovered this flavor by mistake. I picked up someone’s grocery bag at the store by mistake and didn’t realize it till I got home. There was. Mini Honey Salted Carmel Almond ice cream in it. I normally don’t eat ice cream with nuts but I gave it a try. I ate ONE and literally went back to the store to spend $30 on more. This is literally the best thing I’ve ever had.
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This sounded really good so I gave it a try, and I am so happy I did. I LOVE it, and I don’t say that often when it comes to ice cream. Please keep this flavor forever!"
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Otherworldly. I am committed for life. The first ice cream I’ve ever actively recommended to other people.
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is the best flavor that has ever! I never get tired of it and can eat a whole 14 oz in one sitting.
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This stuff is so good, there are no words adequate to describe it. just go get some, NOW!"
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Best icecream in the world..... & soooo hard to find. Pls make more available in stores
31_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This one is the best!!! You cant stop eating. Too good!!!
32_hd,5,5.0,4.0,"Haagen Daaz has done it again with always having the best quality ingredients and superb taste, but this treat is rich and took my taste buds and myself into a place of royalty escape! I absolutely love this treat so much from the brownie cookie to the rich taste of chocolate and spirits. I cant even find another box in my local store! You are missing the best test by far! Rich and decadent!"
32_hd,5,3.0,0.0,Taste and feel of the treat is amazing and would not change a thing. The packaging on the 3 pack I got was 100% recycled paper but was about twice as big as it needed to be for 3 treats to a box.
32_hd,3,2.0,0.0,"With great expectations, took that first bite. Alas, for some reason had salty overtones and some other aftertaste flavor. Definitely, not a favorite."
32_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I was looking for some ice cream for a small birthday party of adults when came across these in Walmart. It looked interesting and and Irish Cream flavor seemed like a good choice for the grown-up birthday party. I was blown away by the absolute creamy deliciousness of this product. Best ice cream novelty Ive ever had. I went back and bought 2 more boxes just to keep them in the house! So good!
32_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I typically I only like the basic ice cream sandwiches; from the first bite I was hooked ! Perfect balance from chocolate to ice cream just great , I hear they are discontinued PLEASE PLEASE RECONSIDER"
32_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Love the taste! Its amazing! But since pandemic, I havent found it. Did you guys stop making it? Please say it aint so!!!"
32_hd,5,1.0,0.0,These are decadent. They dont skimp on anything here. It tastes exactly as it should and is a fulfilling dessert.
32_hd,5,2.0,1.0,These are my fav so far. Tried the vanilla and caramel both good too but this one mmmmm
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I absolutely ""LOVE"" The Irish Cream Brownie Ice Cream!!! Im addicted, for sure. An when Im stressed, have cramps, etc, or just have a craving for ice cream and alcohol. This is the best ice cream I will ever want, ever need, and the tastiest. It just blends so well together. An it makes you crave, even more of it. It makes me very happy and keeps me smiling, especially when I can buy more. I find it extremely hard to just have a little at a time. I hope you never stop making this one. An if you would even make it in the bigger containers. I would be ecstatic!!!!!! As long as you keep making it, I will keep buying it."
33_hd,5,17.0,1.0,"I stopped at my local Haagen Dazs while at a mall. As a lover of Irish cream, I had to try it. I was so incredibly impressed with this flavor and have been craving it ever since. You taste the Irish cream as if its right out of the bottle, and the brownies still have their texture. The amount of chocolate in every bite is in absolute harmony, the brownie bits giving you a break from the intensity of the Irish cream. The chocolate fudge swirls do just enough to complement the creamy base of Irish cream. This is by far the best ice cream I have ever had. I hope I see more of this ice cream as a permanent flavor."
33_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"Thank you, Thank you! For the whole line, I am a person who gets ice cream and adds alcohol. Growing up with a foodie mom, I have always love the flavor combination. Now that you have perfectly paired these flavors, I am in heaven. The Irish Cream is present but not to overwhelm. Then, the brownie comes in to bring in the chocolate to accompany the alcohol just to dance and coat the tongue. Overall a delight and brings me back to the foodie days with my mom. The only thing that I may suggest is that I was a little disappointed that my brownie broke up instead of staying together. It was more Camry than fudge."
33_hd,5,8.0,0.0,Great ice cream. Saves me time in a pinch when making “The BiG Float”; B-Baileys based ice cream on top of a G-Guinness .
33_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"Wow. As somebody who is a intermittent ice cream lover, I decided to purchase this one on a whimp when it was on sale at my local super market. I purchased this ice cream not expecting very much, but oh my was I mistaken? I am not exaggerating when I say this is the BEST ice cream I have had in my life! The way the flavor of the irish cream blends with the smooth texture of the ice cream itself is inspiring. If you like coffee, ice cream, and Baileys, this is your ice cream. I hope this flavor becomes a staple in the product line, I cant imagine it going away!"
33_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"I decided to give the line of Spirits a try. Irish Cream was the first one I was ready to be disappointed. Welp, I wasnt. Its fantastic -- very creamy like flavor. The first thing I sensed was the whiskey content (upwards to 1 proof). Some complain about the coffee taste but, to be honest, the last thing it was was overpowering. I also like the fact that the brownies were ""crumpled"" and there were no large pieces. This made for very easy eating. Its a very well balanced concoction."
33_hd,5,12.0,0.0,Thank You Haagen-dazs. Please never get rid off this flavor. I used to eat a similar flavor from a competitor called dublin mudslide until it was retired. This is that flavor yet improved. Never get rid of this amazing concoction! Cant wait to try it in the ice cream bar format!
33_hd,1,12.0,2.0,Like others I tried this expecting to get back the Baileys ice cream of old but this is not even close and quite a disappointment if you are looking to rekindle your love for the old Baileys ice cream that for some reason seems so popular amongst people yet they will not bring it back? Whats the reasoning Haagen Dazs? Why cant we get the Baileys back even as a limited batch would be sufficient for me.
33_hd,4,3.0,1.0,"I purchased a pint hoping to get something close to the Baileys Irish Cream you used to make. I wasnt expecting the coffee flavor, and while I didnt find it as strong as some people, Im not a fan of coffee so it was disappointing."
33_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I personally enjoy coffee notes so this struck a home run with me. The crumbles of brownie are perfect, you get an even amount with each bite, making it a pleasure to eat rather than having to stop to chomp through a giant brownie chunk. Its creamy with a pleasant undertone of whiskey that is just right. I really enjoyed this ice cream and I cant wait to try the other ones in this Spirits lineup."
33_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"As a lover of irish cream, and a lover of Hagen Dazs ice cream, I saw it in the store and had to have it. I absolutely love the flavor. Tastes like what it is - irish cream ice ream with chocolate pieces."
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I happened to see this in Wegmans. Remembering the Hägen Dazs Bailey’s from the past, I thought why not? I’m lactose intolerant and would take 10 Lactaid pills in order to eat this. Fortunately I only need one or two. I was pleasantly surprised by the fudge ribbons, only expecting brownies and Bailey’s. My all time favorite has been mint and chocolate, but this wipes it out. Even if you can taste coffee, it seems like an obvious brilliant choice seeing as this is geared towards actual adults. But my 12 yo deemed it delicious as well. Now I don’t know why anyone would complain about anything as gorgeous as this creation. I wish I would’ve been a taste tester, because I will NEVER get sick of this flavor. I’ve eaten ice cream in many states, several countries, and I love this so much that I’d give up every other flavor out there."
33_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"My wife and I love this stuff and always have to search for. It never stays on the shelf long in our area, so we buy all they have when we find it."
33_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I never leave reviews so this should say something. No, its not like the OG Bailey, version but its got a fun twist to it. Please dont retire it, and if you do for some reason or another (which Im sure will happen)- put out another Irish cream."
33_hd,3,9.0,4.0,What ever happened to just Plain Baileys Ice Cream.. that was our all time favorite.. and was so disappointed when you stopped making it. This new spirit one is ok but nothing like the original plain Baileys.. IMP....thanks...
33_hd,4,2.0,0.0,"The first time I tasted this, it was amazing. I read the reviews, and yes there is more of a coffee flavor than Irish cream, but its still so good. There are brownie crumbles and pieces. Chocolate shavings that melt in your mouth as you enjoy the smooth, creaminess that you usually get from Haagen-Dazs ice cream. I ended up eating the whole pint myself....oops!"
33_hd,5,3.0,0.0,Thank you ao much for bringing back my favotite flavor and adding an extra treat to it.
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I had missed the Baileys and chocolate flavor you had for awhile. This is even better. Since not in the title I was surprised to see it contained coffee but did not think it overwhelmed the Irish Cream as some mentioned. I didnt realize it was in there until I read it in the ingredients list, maybe because I drink black coffee. Perh"
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Several years ago they had Baileys Irish Cream as a special edition and then it went away. I have been looking for it to come back for years! When I saw this, I almost screamed in the store. While it is not identical to the one years ago, it is perfect in its own way. The taste of the Irish Cream is addictive! Thank you!"
33_hd,2,8.0,4.0,Was disappointed that there was some coffee flavor in this and it wasnt actually labeled that way. Not enough Irish cream flavor in too much coffee flavor for me. I miss their old just Irish cream ice cream.
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I just wanted to try one of the new Spirits collections and picked this one up at the store...needless to say, Irish Cream Brownie surpassed all expectations! The brownie bits are perfect and melt in your mouth, and the flavor of the ice cream itself is heavenly. Great job, Haagen Dazs!"
33_hd,1,6.0,3.0,"I loved the Haagen Daz Baileys Irish Cream flavor and I love brownies, especially with ice cream. What I hate is the taste of coffee and am therefore sensitive to it. For some reason, I taste coffee in this ice cream so its a no for me."
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Im a Belgian Chocolate Fan... so when I saw the ad for these ""spirits"" I decided to try it. I was very happy with the taste. It was great. All ingredients to me was spot on....enjoyed every spoonful. Had to stop myself from eating the whole container..."
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,The different flavors with the sweet and salty taste is amazing and it almost seems like it has a buttery flavor to it and it all just mixes well together. By far my favorite flavor of ice cream.
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Please dont ever discontinue this ice cream. Its the most delicious thing ever put in a carton. I literally cant stop myself from eating the whole container. I LOVE IT!!!!
33_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Im addicted. Need a bigger size!! I this flavor forever!!
33_hd,2,3.0,2.0,"It just Looks and tastes like if you squished brownies into crumbs and sprinkled into Irish cream then froze it. There isnt a separation in flavor nor texture. This ice cream couldve been a hit if it were made with dime size brownie chunks, not crumbles. Its kinda like a frozen brownie cream soup."
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I am in love! Great texture and great flavor. Im not usually one for Irish cream, but this takes the cake for sure! Its not overwhelming or too rich. The brownies add a perfect texture, I just wish there were a little bit more. I would love totally buy this more often if it were in a bigger size."
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Tried it on a whim a few weeks ago, have bought once a week as a treat ever since. Perfectly creamy and flavorful. I look forward to my one indulgence every week."
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Really enjoyed this, I could immediately taste the liquor. Went to the haagen daaz at the mall, now I want to go buy at the grocery store and see if its the same"
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This was love at first bite. I buy it all the time. My only issue is that it doesnt come in a larger size. It gets really expensive after a while.
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Amazing, reminds me of eggnog slightly, has such an amazing flavor! I mean I liked the flavor enough to write a review"
33_hd,5,1.0,0.0,It’s so good I literally got one almost everyday when I was near the shop
34_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"Alright, Im going to be very honest about this review. I cannot express how delicious this Lemon Sorbet is to me and my daughter. When I come home from a hard days work and I see Lemon Sorbet in the freezer, I am thankful of this little carton of awesomeness and delicious desert. I am very disappointed that I have not had any lemon sorbet in 3 months, please restock at the Albertsons in Fallbrook, California (on Ammunition Rd) thank you."
34_hd,5,9.0,2.0,"Anyone who cant eat dairy this is PERFECT for you. Its even better than the almond, coconut, and cashew milk ice creams Ive tried and its a lot cheaper than those as well. Its super creamy just like ice cream but without the dairy."
34_hd,5,4.0,0.0,I just ate my first scoop of lemon sorbet. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lemon flavor or anyone who is looking for a refreshing treat during the summer.
34_hd,5,6.0,2.0,"Smooth, creamy consistency and a flavor that is not overly tart but is pure perfection."
34_hd,5,4.0,1.0,"This is my ultimate favorite flavor. Its light but satisfying, sour but sweet, icey but smooth. Basically it’s perfect! Best refresher on a hit day or light dessert after dinner"
34_hd,5,3.0,1.0,Been my favorite ice cream since I was 10. The new packing seems to have exponentially better texture. So silky and tart.
34_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"the lemon sorbet is my absolute FAVE!!! its a sweet tart and cleanses the palate and so very refreshing and light, cant wait to have more"
34_hd,5,3.0,2.0,"I truly enjoy the zesty lemon, I put in my moscato and its so good. I buy the sweet sparkling white moscato add 2 to 3 tablespoons and sip very slowly and while Im sipping I would stop take my spoon and eat the ice cream its the best tasting ice wine that I ever had. I do recommend this if youre not 21 years old"
34_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Wonderful taste and so creamy! I eat a scoop every day.
35_hd,1,9.0,0.0,"I thought this looked amazing. Decided to splurge since we’re on lockdown and I needed a treat. While the layers in the ice cream tasted ok, there wasn’t a raspberry sauce layer. Bummer."
35_hd,5,11.0,1.0,"My whole family used to avoid the trios because of how nearly all of them contain chocolate ice cream or caramel. Chocolate ice cream has always been too sweet for my family’s liking, and even as a child (currently 21) I leaned towards fruity or nutty flavors. Mango was my family’s absolute favorite and we were thrilled when Haagendaz started producing it again recently. But this ice cream is the PERFECT blend of zesty and sweet. The lemon ice cream adds a certain depth and refreshment that the other flavors don’t have! The chocolate layer is thin enough to be crispy and light in flavor! Highly recommend this icecream! Now if only they would stop selling out!"
35_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"I usually don’t write reviews ( yeah bad I know, especially when you are happy with the product) I enjoyed this ice cream to the point of disappointment. I ate the entire thing in one sitting and became upset because it’s now gone! (Again, bad I know) each flavor had the right amount sweetfullness and flavor. The white chocolate wasn’t overpowering and added the right touch of richness. I love love love this ice cream and this is coming from a person who always skips the ice cream and goes straight for the cake! You guys get an A+!!! Please get this flavor in rotation!"
35_hd,4,1.0,0.0,The lemon and raspberry flavors could use more of a punch (acidity). A thicker raspberry flavor would also help. The ice cream texture and the amount/quality of the white chocolate are excellent.
35_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I never thought that I would find an ice cream that I would consider grabbing before my favorite Strawberry Haagen Dazs, but this flavor ranks high up there and I will definitely be swapping between the two. Not too sweet, no artificial raspberry or lemon flavor. To me it has a very light homemade flavor, but them packs a punch with the classic HD taste. SOOOO impressed by this ice cream!!!"
35_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive been an ice cream lover most my life . Ive tried several brands and only a couple are as cold clean and texture that Haagen-Dazs has. My favorite flavor is , lemon white chocolate raspberry crispy layers. Why cant I buy it in larger sizes than 14 ozs.? Im having a celebration of life after my mothers funeral on March 11th and would like to serve this flavor at her reception . Where can I buy larger containers of this flavor ? I didnt want to have many ice cream cartons sitting around."
35_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I am a vanilla girl (favorite ice cream) all the way, but I love when Haagen-Dazs comes up with a ice cream that makes you feel like a child in a candy store. This is one of the best!!!! Great Job."
35_hd,1,2.0,0.0,The layers of raspberry and lemon are not as pictured on this website. I basically do not taste any lemon and definitely do not taste raspberry. If I could upload a picture I would.
35_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Wasnt sure about this flavor combination, until I tried it. Possibly the best ice cream flavor ever! Was sold out when I went back for more."
35_hd,5,2.0,0.0,This one is so delicious. Finally an amazing flavor including lemon. Please don’t ever get rid of it.
35_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is simply the best flavor I have ever put in my face! I am a culinary snob and this is by far my favorite. It is light sweet and sour with a nice pallate cleanse from the smooth white chocolate. I have to travel out of state to get this now (I can not find it in Houston). I love this...this would probably be the dessert I would eat if I had one more day to live.
35_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Literally the best ice cream I have ever eaten. I ate a whole pint in one sitting. The white chocolate layers are perfectly thin that you get some in every bite but not too much. The layers go all the way to the bottom. Obsessed is an understatement everyone needs this in their lives!!!!! Please dont ever make this flavor go away.
35_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The lemom-rasberry trio is the best tasting blend of sweet and lemony then the addition of the white chocolate.This the most satisfying ice cream we have ever had.My wife and I can eat a pint and then look for more. We want to thank Haagen-Dazs for this wonderful confectionary.
35_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this flavor. The lemon is an subtle and creamy, the raspberry sauce is perfect and the white chocolate just makes it perfect. I cant get enough."
35_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"Expect Lemon flavor, but cant find it. No layer at all, a little bit too sweet"
36_hd,5,17.0,0.0,"I dont allow myself to buy this ice cream very often. Not because I buy other flavors or prefer other brands but because when I buy a pint of mango Haagen dazs (even one thats supposed to be saved for later) I end up eating the whole thing in one sitting. I have no willpower over it. Between the creamy texture, and perfect mango flavor, Once I have one spoonful - I gotta have all of it. No ifs, ands, or buts about it."
36_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"Ive always loved Mango and the Sorbet was one of my favorites but the new Mango Ice Cream, Wow!!! This is the next best thing to what was my absolute favorite flavor so many years ago, you ""PEACH"" ICE CREAM!! Every summer I still search the freezer section hoping just maybe you brought it back, but no luck :(! Thats how I discovered this new Mango. With chunks of mango and the oh so smooth cream its my end of the day reward that makes everything soo much better with a drizzle of Caramel syrup :0! But OMG your other New Favors are also to die for, Ive been a Haagen-Dazs junkie literally for decades. Without a doubt when I crave ice cream HD is always my first choice!!! Thank you for being there!!!!!"
36_hd,5,6.0,0.0,This is essentially the best ice scream man kind ever make.
36_hd,5,3.0,0.0,So I love mango ice creams and I make it a point to try the mango flavor every time I am in an ice cream store. The mango ice cream in the USA is bit dull compared to whats available outside.
36_hd,5,4.0,0.0,I just love this ice cream. I dont have words to express. After a long time i have found an ice cream with such taste. I bought 2/3 boxes of this every week. I request HD Team come up with a bigger size of this tastiest ice cream. It would be a huge hit for sure.

I just made a run up to the grocery store to get more, as Im eating 1/2 pint every night now. The flavor is intensely mango and fabulous, not too sweet, very creamy and full of small chunks of real mango as well. I hope this becomes a permanent flavor, as I dont know what I will do without it! Honestly...its THAT good!!!"

36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This Mango Ice Cream - where do I start? I was going to take a taste and ended up eating the entire tub. It is nothing short of spectacular, and so much so, that I have anxiety when the three grocery stores I shop and Amazon Fresh were either out or had only one left. I am from the islands, so the mango taste is authentic and the bits of mango throughout are genius, happy additions of mango-y perfection. I am hooked."
36_hd,5,2.0,0.0,We absolutely love this ice cream but recently having trouble finding one in stores near us.

36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Haagen Dazs Mango Ice Cream has the best Mango ice cream. Please have this flavor permanently. Recently I noticed the changed on Haagen Dazs and the first thing I noticed is that I cant seem to find this Mango ice cream anywhere now. Target Store stopped selling this flavor. Please bring it back and let it stay permanently. Love this ice cream.
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Being from SE Asian subcontinent, I know mangoes. So naturally, I am looking for this flavor whenever I go for groceries. This is the best mango ice cream (that includes most imported varieties) I have been able to find in the stores - creamy, sweet, flavorful, and addictive. My only gripe is that most local stores dont keep it in stock."
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this ice cream so much! I was delighted to see my walmart had it but then it dissappeared :( I bought two tubs, finished one and am now savoring the last one since once again youve stopped distributing them...I would love to buy ten cartons if there is any way possible :, ( I love it and crave it at least a few times monthly."
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,My husband and I tried this on a whim and then I bought like 184739 of them by myself and hid them. Theyre perfect for my cravings! I think this was the mango ice cream that was made like two years ago and then it was discontinued for just the sorbet one but then they brought it back and Im just so happy. :)
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The mango ice cream is the absolute creamiest I have ever tasted in my life. I love most of your flavors but mango is perfection. And the real mango bits prove this is a quality product. Please do not ever stop making this selection. Please...
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Luscious, creamy mango ice cream. I normally dont like chunks of stuff in my ice cream, but the mango pieces are a nice addition. My only complaint is that this should be available in a LARGER size. Cmon H-D, package these in quarts* too!"
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is hands down the best mango ice cream Ive ever had. Its super creamy, milky and the mango flavor really shines through. Plus I love how there are chunks of mango pieces throughout. You cant go wrong with this one."
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I normally buy the Pineapple Coconut flavor but saw Mango and decide to try it. OMG!! This mango ice cream is AMAZING!! I couldn’t stop eating it. I still like pineapple coconut but the Mango flavor is now my absolute fav.
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Once I tried this ice-cream, I instantly knew it was my favorite. Its one of the few ice-cream flavors that really captivate my love for ice cream. It is so irresistibly creamy , with a slight tang and bite of mango."

36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Oh my goodness, I just love, love, love this flavor! We will be celebrating our 16 years anniversary on Halloween, my hubby is a former Marine, and now a police officer with the local sheriff. We have four children ages, 17, 14, 5, and 3; I love them to pieces. I refuse to however, share my Haagen-Dazs experience with them; and they dont understand. They seem to think that I am selfish for not willing to share; the nerve of some people! I teach 7th grade middle school, and brutal would be an understatement. I knew what I had to do; go to the store and stack up on my emergency stress supplies As Im typing this review, I am slowly finishing a quart of my favorite flavor (mango) while grading essays. Although I am happily married, I told hubby that I would trade our ""I do"" to say ""Yes, please""married for If I had been guaranteed by your company that I would get a free lifetime supply of Haagen-Dazs. This is review, but I dont care, love should be declared loudly, shamelessly, and constantly. Dang, I have to go, Im out of my better half. To Haagen-Dazs, From Your #1 Fan I promise you, no fake love here!"
36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I use to buy pineapple coconut all the time but I saw the Mango flavor I said let me try it this time since that day I only buy mang ice cream. Great teast.

36_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is the only ice cream I will eat and now I can’t find it anywhere!! Please bring it back! I’m in the Midwest and I’ll drive anywhere to get it!

37_hd,5,24.0,2.0,"How good is the mango sorbet? Well, it taste like real mangos. I had the secondary part of root canal done. I was in pain, hungry, angry, and again: hungry. I needed something to eat. I was feeling so sour inside, walking through the supermarket towards the pharmacy, to get medication, for my tooth ache. All of sudden, I heard the voice... ""come to me... come to the novelties and ice cream section and find me""... bought two pints that night. Yes, its that darn good. Definitely, the best sorbet flavor Ive ever had and Im not that much of a fan of mangos."
37_hd,5,7.0,1.0,Your Mango Sorbet is simply wonderful! I use to get your ice cream but found I am lactose intolerant . When I found this sorbet I was very happy and thankful. Our stores keep running out of it and it is one of the only things I can eat. Please send more to Myrtle Beach!
37_hd,5,5.0,0.0,My daughter and I can eat this everyday! Light and tastes great! The only downside... its hard to find in the grocery store. Its a rare find so I buy 2 or 3 at a time!
37_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Icy smooth and real mango. Im hooked. Nothing else compares to the quality and taste of Haagen-Dazs Mango Sorbet. This has been my favorite for years.
37_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I love this flavor. I buy it ALL the time when Im craving at Target! Great price, Great texture, GREAT TASTE! Its a must have. :)"
38_hd,1,222.0,6.0,"Mint chip with skim milk, corn syrup, corn starch? Why are you changing favorites by adding junk ingredients? And it’s less minty with no real chocolate. Nestle, you already have enough money, don’t cheapen an American favorite. People, check your ingredients before you buy any haagendazs. Many flavors have been compromised."
38_hd,2,200.0,3.0,"So disappointed to see the inclusion of corn syrup, corn starch, and soy lecithin -- all presumably GMO since noe is organic -- in this product. The packaging was redesigned. Why must the recipe be altered, too?"
38_hd,3,167.0,0.0,"While the flavor was fine (not great), the list of ingredients left much to be desired. Cut out the cheap (and cheap tasting) corn syrup!"
38_hd,1,128.0,0.0,I used to love this flavor and it was rich and sweet before they changed the new carton packaging design!!! They keep saying the recipe hasnt changed but after few years they cant use that as an excuse anymore!!! Because even others notice it as well so its not me!!! Now the recipe in my opinion taste like Turkey Hills Natural Mint Chocolate Chip to me and I couldve gotten 2 half gallons for the price of 1 container of Haagen Dazs!!! The ice cream part taste like a mint water ice now and the chocolate chips seem harder now that it hurts my teeth like eating broken glass!!! Also they taste like cardboard and it used to taste like a yummy hot chocolate flavor to me!!! Last when I picked it up in the store the weight seem like really light like picking up a feather and it used be a little heavy so I know there using cheap ingredients now!!! I am sad now since most brands are changing their recipe and making it horrible and thought Haagen Dazs wouldnt do that especially due to the price of 1 small container!!! If anyone like this flavor now just get Turkey Hills Natural Mint Chocolate Chip kind and you can get 2 half gallons for the price of 1 Haagen Dazs container and get more servings out of it!!!
38_hd,1,189.0,7.0,"Really disappointed with this flavor. No mint taste, and for sure no mint smell. Without question, this is the flavor that I will not purchase again. Stick with vanilla and get better flavor."
38_hd,1,204.0,4.0,"Great flavor, but harmful ingredients. Why add corn syrup, artificial flavors, ect? I will not eat this."
38_hd,1,198.0,4.0,The quality just isnt there anymore and It doesnt taste any better then a normal vanilla ice cream cone.
38_hd,1,210.0,4.0,Yup it’s even in Hagen Dazs now... the ingredients have changed across the board.
38_hd,1,12.0,0.0,Was a great product now it’s junk with fake ingreds. Not cool. And you still charge huge bucks for garbage. It’s like you think we can’t taste the difference. I will go pick one off the shelf and will turn it around and if I see corn syrup and chemicals I will put it back on the shelf. News flash- it tastes like plastic chemicals- it’s gross.
38_hd,1,5.0,2.0,"Just like the vanillla, apparantly they change this receipie too .. Used to be really good, now it´s average at best. Very dissapointed, I hope you go broke"
38_hd,2,3.0,1.0,"I am a huge fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream, my favorite part being the chocolate chips. Unfortunately, this pint of ice cream did not have many chocolate chips throughout it. I’m not sure if I grabbed a bad pint but this made for an overall unsatisfied customer."
38_hd,1,3.0,1.0,Ive been eating Haagen days for over 20 years. Im not sure why the recipe drastically changed but Im not in impressed.
38_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This has been my favorite ice cream since day one. Love the subtle mint and the chocolate chips.
39_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"I have been an addict of HD peanut butter & chocolate ice cream, for years. However, I am ashamed of myself after consuming an entire pint... so, I chose to try these. They are PERFECTION. I love everything about them - the size, the chocolate cookie, the swirls of pb and chocolate. DELICIOUS"
39_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Perfect balance of cookie and peanut butter. I will be getting more. Thanks Haagen Dazs for delicious new indulgence.
39_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I LLLLOOVEEEE these cookie squares, they were my go-to ice cream choice - always! But I dont see them at HEB or any other grocery store anymore :( What happened Haagen Dazs? I dont know where I can buy these in Texas. Bring them backkkk!"
40_hd,2,3.0,1.0,"I was initially excited when I picked this up because it was very clear from the photo on the front of the pint that this was not a chocolate-based flavor. The vast majority of the ""peanut butter"" flavors among the various light/low-calorie ice cream brands are chocolate-centric rather than peanut butter-centric. Alas, other than the occasional swirls of what seems to be actual peanut butter contained throughout, there is very little peanut butter flavor in this product. I would recommend reformulating so that the ice cream base flavor has a pronounced peanut butter flavor. You could then reduce or even remove the peanut butter swirls to save on calories if needed."
40_hd,5,2.0,0.0,The taste is fantastic and Rich. Highly recommend.
41_hd,5,16.0,0.0,"I used to be obsessed with HD coffee ice cream (with dairy) and consider Haagen Dazs to be the cream of the crop for ice cream brands. However, I havent been able to tolerate dairy for years now and many vegan ice cream brands dont have the right texture or flavor which is disappointing and not worth the calories. I gave up on ever having ice cream again and I know a lot of people in the same boat. Anyway, I didnt think it was possible, but you guys made dairy-free ice cream taste exactly like (if not better) than the real thing! I felt immediately compelled to write a heartfelt thank you after my first few bites. Incredible job! Many thanks!!!"
41_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"Unbelievably delicious! The ingredients are wholesome. No bad additives. No harmful gums. The pectin in it is the least reactive in the gut when compared to all the rest of the gums. Very hard to put it down if you eat directly from the tub. The fudge is made from this great tasting cocoa! I used to be confined to the Coconut Carmel flavor for a long time because of my gut problems and it is delicious; but the Peanut Butter Fudge non dairy beats it hands down!! If you can, try to take the serving size in a chilled bowl (it melts fast at room temperature) as it is hard to stop eating when you eat directly from the tub!!"
41_hd,5,12.0,0.0,"I was so excited that Haagen Dazs finally had vegan options, and now theyve added even more items! Still, this one is the best in my opinion. Creamy, rich peanut butter with the most delicious chocolate Ive ever had in an ice cream (vegan or otherwise). Id buy bars of just the chocolate if I could! Highly recommend if you like the peanut butter + chocolate combo."
41_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"Our family is vegan, so its great to see some dairy-free options from Haagen Daaz. This is one of my favorite flavors so far. It has a delicious combination of peanut butter and chocolate flavors. Highly recommend this one."
41_hd,5,6.0,0.0,I have had lots of vegan ice creams. I was SO excited when you guys started making it. It’s amazing. Stoked I can go get ice cream that I know is the right texture and flavor. It’s the same as real ice cream. Highly recommend. The trio one is also SO GOOD. But harder to find
41_hd,5,6.0,0.0,Very happy that this product is non-dairy and tasty. One would not be able to spot the difference. Im on my third cup this month and do not regret it.
41_hd,5,5.0,1.0,"Vegan and lactose intolerant so ice cream has been coconut milk based and through a mail order service. The chocolate salted truffle I tried in NY is amazing. I live in Massachusetts on an island and can’t find it here, I’ve had to enlist someone out of state (in New York) to bring some to me. Good thing or I’d be eating it all the time. I can only imagine what the peanut butter chocolate tastes like,"
41_hd,5,4.0,0.0,By far the best ice cream since going vegan 3 years ago
41_hd,5,5.0,2.0,Haagen dazs has definitely crushed the non-dairy market with this one. My God this stuff is delicious! A five star rating doesnt even do it justice.
41_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This dairy free ice cream is the best that Ive had , even better than many regular ice cream Ive had in my youth. Please who think you cant have good vegan ice cream dont know what theyre missing because this is heavenly <3"
42_hd,5,6.0,0.0,The ice cream is so thick and creamy with the right amount of peanut butter flavor. The chocolate coating is SO DECADENT and MILKY (Without cow’s milk!). LOVE-LOVE. I’d have to try the other non-dairy flavors!! It’s even better than the dairy kind!!!
42_hd,5,5.0,0.0,We recently tried these and they are amazing. Its hard to believe they contain no dairy - they are smooth and every bit as delicious as regular Haagen Daz bars. Note: BJs Wholesale is now carrying them; we saw them there and decided to try them because the price was good. So glad we did.
42_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"so sooooo good, the perfect amount of sweetness, mixed w the crispy thin chocolate shell makes this an addicting treat. It’s probably a good thing that they only come in packs of 3 since I would easily gorge on a pack of 10 haha (but for real please make bigger packs!!)"
42_hd,5,3.0,0.0,These are the best Non-Dairy dessert bars my wife and I have tried. They are better than most (if not all) actual ice cream bars. Even our eight year old loves them. Decadent and delicious. We have been buying them at our local BJ’s and are very sad that they are not currently available there.
42_hd,5,6.0,1.0,LOVE this so much it tastes better than dairy ice cream!
42_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This is the perfect dessert for any pb chocolate fan. I absolutely love the flavor, texture, low sugar content and great macros of this bar. Now I can indulge without breaking my diet!!!! Please continue to make this and other non-dairy/gluten-free flavors. :)"
42_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"Hands down this is delicious. The peanut butter is not overwhelming and that is coming from someone who doesnt LOVE peanut butter but tolerates it. I am a chocolate lover and this is by far the best combination, especially cold. If you are looking for a non-dairy ""ice cream"" bar you must try this one!"
42_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Thank you so much for making nondairy treats that taste great!
43_hd,5,15.0,0.0,"I love this ice cream. It’s smooth, creamy, minty and chocolate combo is what has me addicted to it.

I bought the last six."

43_hd,5,16.0,0.0,I feel like an addict trying to find this ice cream. Its so good but I dont have a Haagen Dazs near me. Ive even tried to substitute it by buying talenti gelato ice cream that makes peppermint bark but its not the same and the store that was carrying it now stopped a month ago. Lord I wish it was December just so I could have my ice cream

43_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"I await every holiday season for this flavor to come back! Like another customer mentioned, when I see pints of Peppermint Bark ice cream available in a grocery store, I wipe the shelves clean and stock up my freezer! Im obsessed with all things peppermint bark but nothing is better than this ice cream!"
43_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"IMO, this is their best ice cream, period! I would eat it all year long if it were available, which would certainly save me from driving around to all the nearby grocery stores during the brief 2-3 weeks it is available and cleaning out their stock!"
43_hd,5,4.0,0.0,This is absolutely delicious. It should not just be sold at the holidays. I would eat this all year around. I just finished my last pint. If you love peppermint bark you must try this. You won’t be disappointed. Please sell this all Year long!

45_hd,3,11.0,8.0,"I’ve been eating the pineapple coconut ice cream for a little over 2 years now and I love it. Today, I looked at the ingredients and realize it has alcohol in it. I immediately had to stop eating it being as though it is against my religion to consume alcohol. Do anyone know if this ice cream is made without alcohol in it? I am highly upset."
45_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"I like ice cream that tastes like piña colada, but am pretty picky about the taste. Most other brands have too much pineapple. This is the perfect mix. Thanks Häagen Dazs!"

So I got my 2 and went Home to try out this New Stuff, and I did try Both Pints! I Drove Back to the Grocery Store and Bought as Many as I was allowed to bye. I found 4 Flavors that I Like a Lot, and One that I Love! The Pistachio Ice Cream that you all make is the BEST made by Anyone in the Continental U.S., and I Know this for a Fact! I am the Ice Cream AFICIONADO, and I Know what is Good, what has the Best Products Used in their Ice Cream, and they Do Use Lots of Pistachio’s in Every Pint, that’s a Fact!!"
46_hd,5,11.0,2.0,Im so happy Haagen Daaz decided to bring this flavor back. Its the best Pistachio Ive ever had. My heart literally skipped a beat when I unexpectedly saw this at the grocery store. Unfortunately not a lot of retailers carry this flavor so I do have to drive around a bit but its so worth it. Thanks HD for bringing this flavor back & please dont discontinue it again.
46_hd,5,11.0,2.0,"For 51 years, Id never eaten ice cream before, I just could never stand the site of it. Well, three weeks ago, I just was walking by the ice cream section in my local grocery store and I reached in and grabbed a pint of Haagan Dazss pistachio ice cream. I brought it home, grabbed a spoon, sat down at the kitchen table, and tried it. Twenty four minutes later I was staring at the bottom of the container wondering where it all went. Ive been buying one pint a week since then."

I was watching my favorite Friday night show, and thought hmmm.. let me try that ice cream. 30 minutes later, I had nothing left to try, because I ate it all!!!"
46_hd,4,4.0,0.0,I used to eat the pistachio gelato that you had. When it was discontinued I bought everyone I came across in my area and almost cried. When I saw that you were bringing the pistachio flavor back I was so excited and this is very good. I have to say that I prefer the smooth flavor that the pistachio gelato had but this is very good as well. This is the best pistachio flavored ice cream out at this time but the gelato was so much better!
46_hd,1,6.0,5.0,"I cannot believe you call this ice cream pistachio ice cream. It is cream ice cream with pistachio nuts. Where is the green pistachio ice cream? Where is the pistachio flavor in the ice cream? The only pistachios in your ice cream are the tiny bits of nuts, that don’t even taste of pistachio, as they are so small. You misrepresent a wonderful product, and I am so surprised you get away with it. Your “pistachio”:ice cream has been voted one of the 10 best? I can’t believe this. I am greatly disappointed and it is turning me off to Haggen Dasz."
46_hd,1,4.0,0.0,"makes for a poor, soggy tasting experience :( haagen dazs pistachio ice icream used to have whole roasted pistachios in their ice cream, which gave it crunchy texture, and made it a pleasant, enjoyable pleasure, not anymore!"

46_hd,1,1.0,0.0,Hello Im new to the Haagen-Dazs family well majority are good but the pistachio is terrible I know its wealthy company I dont understand wheres the pistachios there so lil small barely taste them Ben and Jerrys give you a surprise in mostly each bite the cream even have same great taste Haagen-Dazs pistachio it just taste like vanilla w lil tink pieces plz make it better tasting dont be around to put real pistachios in it
46_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"Very disappointing. No pistachio taste at all. End result was just having to pick little pieces of broken, tasteless nuts out of my teeth."
46_hd,1,1.0,0.0,The texture and flavor of the ice cream has changed!!! So disappointed!!! Done buying this ice cream. It was my favorite and could eat the whole container in one sitting. I just opened one and didn’t even eat a fourth of it and put it back in the freezer. Less pistachios too which I like but the vanilla used to be so crisp and flavorful. Now? It tastes cold and a little sweet. Doesn’t hit that spot anymore...
46_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"I love the texture and taste of this flavor, but I cant give it 5 stars for one reason only: The nut pieces are too small."
46_hd,1,2.0,1.0,I have been eating your pistachio ice cream for many years and the last two cartons purchased were completely different. The nuts where little bitty pieces of skin with minimal flavor. You previously used large nuts and it was full flavored. You Customer Service rep tried to convince us it was a mistake in the batch we bought. Not likely.
46_hd,1,3.0,1.0,"Not much flavor, tiny pieces of pistachio were a disappointment."
46_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"This is the absolute worst ""Pistachio"" ice cream I ever ate. It doesnt taste like Pistachio at all. I expected large pieces or chunks of Pistachios, but it contains nothing but tiny microscopic pieces with no flavor at all. I also found the texture grainy and not creamy. I would never buy this again or recommend it."
46_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"I love haagen-dazs. Dont get me wrong. I was so excited for this ice cream. Ive never had pistachio ice cream and my family was telling me that I would love it. My mother put it best. Its bland. Very disappointed. Wont be going back to pistachio, thats for sure. The only good thing is that its a creamy ice cream."

But, my last 2 pints have not packed the strong raspberry flavor I am used to, the texture was still spot on (very smooth, excellent mouthfeel), but the flavor was, well, watery. It was just sweet, no tang."
47_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"One of my favorite flavors! Its even better when you mix it with chocolate ice cream. That combination is the most delicious thing Ive ever eaten. I was never a fan of ice cream back when I was okay with consuming milk. The first time I bought this, I actually bought it for someone else. After trying it though, Im addicted!"
47_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love most raspberry inspired food, but Haagen-Daz hit it right on the nail! I have never has such a refreshing flavor! It tastes just like raspberries, and I have tried other brands. This is definitely my favorite! Please stock more, I have trouble finding it."

48_hd,5,12.0,0.0,"So, I was in my favorite Café having dinner. And this little old lady sitting across from me decided to strike up a conversation. Further on in the conversation, we started talking about ice cream. And she told me about this rocky road. She described in such a way that I had to go and buy it that night. And oh my goodness was she ever so right! I am hooked! This stuff is crack! Its now my favorite flavor! Its like no other rocky road Ive ever tasted! Marshmallow cream and almonds in every bite!"
48_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"This is my absolute favorite Ice Cream Flavor and Haagen-dazs has the PERFECT recipe. You will find a perfect blend of marshmellow, chocolate and almonds. I have tried plenty of other Rocky Road ice creams and no one compares to HD. They stopped selling this flavor at my local store, so I drive the 5.7 miles to my local Target everytime I am craving this. Stop trying to find the perfect Rocky Road, honestly STOP. THIS IS IT! All the ingredients are great quality and the flavor is just out of this world!"
48_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"Absolutely the best ice cream! Im an ice cream fanatic and love ice cream even in the winter, which is the best (it doesnt melt). Ive tried a lot of ice creams...store brought and homemade, but this one here is by far better than any ice cream out there. The sweet creamy smooth marshmallows and perfect crunch almonds are so good."

49_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"It doesnt have a whole bunch of stuff in it, but I think thats the beauty of it, and I love this product for that exact reason. Its creaminess and sweetness is perfectly balanced, then the delightful taste of Rose wine is so yummy and refreshing!"
49_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I understand if someone else wishes the flavor to be a bit stronger, but in my personal opinion... I truly love this flavor. It creamy and you can taste the rosé. Oooo this gave me a new idea for an ice cream. Sangria wine? With... well idk but I’m sure this company can think of something amazing for it!"
49_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"I have been looking for a wine-flavoured ice cream, ever since my favourite flavour, Zabaglione, by a local ice cream brand became very difficult to find. When I saw that Haagen-Dazs had come up with a similar concept, I decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! It is creamy, has a good balance between sweet and ""sparkling fermented beverage"" flavour and is refreshing! I could eat an entire pint in one day, so I have to be very careful!"
49_hd,2,3.0,1.0,"went to get the Bourbon truffle, and saw this had to try, it was good but lacked in flavor a little, I could taste hints of the rose but it could have been just a stronger. I did notice that it seemed my carton had only one streak of the flavor, perhaps 2 or three would have made it perfect, still good and I would try again"
49_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"And let me tell you, I love it so much. I was shopping for groceries at a Wal-Mart and I saw this. I was simply in love with it. I loved how creamy and smooth it was. I never knew that Haagen-daz has a Spirits line!"
49_hd,5,3.0,2.0,Absolutely loved loved loved this. My taste buds thanked Haagen Dazs with every single bite. I have to say that this is my new all time favorite. Please don’t let this flavor retire.
49_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love how this ice cream has layers. The sweet cream, is nicely smoothed over the tempered tartness of the rose wine. The boldness and complexity of this combo makes it hard to not eat the entire container from start to finish."
49_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Im writing this as I devour a small bowl of this amazing ice-cream for the first time. Its fruity (mixed berry or strawberry), creamy and has a great texture. Needs to be a permanent flavor. The whole Spirits line, really."
49_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I looked up this site expressly to write a review for the Rosě & Cream because I want to add my voice in as someone who truly appreciates how different, how supreme it is. With the slightest hint of acidic, barely sweet grape threading through a mellow cream base this ice cream flavor lacks nothing and in my opinion, is a distinct flavor concept worth pursuing in context of the spirits line or a separate line. I have tried a good number of the spirits line, liked them but didnt find that they were remarkable in terms of what is in the market already. Also, anything I found had nuts and generally, a lot going on. Rosé & Cream is simply two flavors playing off of each other in a deliciously complicated taste sensation. If I went to the store tomorrow and found Whiskey & Cream, Amaretto & Cream, Rum & Cream and then Chablis & Cream, Chianti & Cream etc. Id have a tough time deciding what to get, what to try next. Meantime, whether you take this idea for a run or not, I am concerned that the Rosé flavor will be discontinued and wanted people at Haagen Daz to be aware of people out here passionate about the product."
49_hd,5,1.0,0.0,We tried this on a whim and it was so tasty! Usual high quality from Haagen-Dazs - so creamy and not too sweet

49_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"It was so delicious! Flavor was bold, Texture was smooooth, and it all made me very happy!"
50_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"First review here, but this bar is worth the effort! After checking out the ingredients, I was surprised at how the flavours of berry and chocolate came together without any additional berry flavourings. I dig that Haagen-Dazs took advantage of this unique chocolate process to create such a unique bar."
50_hd,4,6.0,0.0,I enjoyed the creamy taste of the ice cream paired with the crispy and tangy taste of the shell!!!
50_hd,5,4.0,0.0,By far my favorite ice cream. The sweet and tangy ruby chocolate is perfectly matched with the smooth delectable cream. Will work for haagen dazs ruby cacao bars! I will write to Congress to make sure these bars become permanent! Ruby cacao 2020!!
50_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Ive been wanting to try something with ruby cacao and discovered this! At first bite, I tasted something with a similar intensity to dark chocolate but then the berry flavor kicked in. It wasnt overwhelming nor was it bland. The flavor blended well with the ice cream resulting in a smooth and somewhat tart taste. Will definitely buy again!"
50_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Exactly as described. A smooth fruity taste on outside. And creamy ice cream on the inside. Doesn’t have a strong chocolate taste but it’s okay because it’s delicious and the fruit is the star here.
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"i had no idea what Ruby Cacao was. I bought these on a whim. I am now hopelessly addicted. please dont discontinue! ill perish. I love the unique taste of the ruby cacao that you use. Its the best quality. ive bought ruby cacao chocolate from other sources, but yours is the absolute best."
50_hd,2,2.0,1.0,"i tasted the ruby ones with strawberry ice cream inside. i was really excited since it looked so cool, it tastes disgusting. the chocolate was meh but the ice cream that went among tasted sour almost like cheese. it was COMPLETELY unworth it. never buying again."
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Oh my god! These are so amazing. Not a fan of the original chocolate shell but these are amazing. The shell is so unique and tangy and the icecream is so rich and creamy, not too sweet or overpowering. So sad these are limited edition"
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I cant get enough of these bars. I wish I could find somewhat I could buy a case of them. I am truly disappointed that these will be discontinued. I buy every box any store that carries them has and still not enough.
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Im not into chocolate at all but this just became my new obsession. The sweet berry and chocolate is so smooth and mellow. Then the sweet cream ice is the perfect finish. PLEASE DONT TAKE IT AEAY
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The very unique tangy flavor of the ruby cacao really complements the subtle taste of the ice cream. Really wish these weren’t limited edition!
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Different! But sooooo good! I wish it wasn’t “limited edition “! Can’t find it anywhere online. Bring it back !!!
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I have always been curious with Ruby chocolate and glad I found this. It taste fruity and refreshing
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I enjoyed this flavor so very much. I kind taste the sweetness of the cacao.
50_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Super unique taste. And the cream is refreshing and not heavy.
51_hd,4,6.0,1.0,"At first I thought it would be a disappointment because I only felt the pistachio and white cream. Very sweet, the flavors merged into one. When a generous piece of ruby cacao came to my mouth it was redemption !!! It felt like I was having a big party, a mix New Years Eve in Copacabana with 4th July with lots of fireworks !!! LoL. Unusual, sour and citrus flavor was raised as the main flavor. My suggestion ( for next ice cream s)would be to intensify the pistachio flavor and not overdo it with sugar, it would be an elegant and sophisticated flavor."
51_hd,5,5.0,4.0,"Finally there is a ice cream brand in the US using ruby chocolate to be their ice cream flavor. As a trend, ruby chocolate becomes popular around the world. the ice cream is so smooth and not too sweet. Also the pistachio adds more flavor on it. I only can find one location in my town is available to get this ice cream. I wish there will be more stores can be available too"
51_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I bought this ice cream at Walamart. The design looks good and the taste is super nice! I really like it. What a nice and detailed flavor. I would buy this again. Please don’t remove or cancel this product.
51_hd,5,6.0,1.0,"I did not like the last TRIO flavor I tried (Lemon Raspberry White Chocolate) and I wasnt expecting much from this, but I am a pistachio fanatic. The sweet cream was also a perk. The ice cream is so smooth and delicate. I would be happy if this came without the ruby cacao, but it does add a little zing. Unlike other chocolate Ive encountered in frozen form, the flavor of the ruby cacao is immediate-- a little sweet, a little tart."
51_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"Its so creamy and delicious, I cant get enough! The ruby cacao stripes add the perfect amount of crunch and delicate berry flavor... omg I am obsessed!"

51_hd,5,8.0,1.0,Absolutely awesome. Unique berry taste pair well with the pistachio butter ice cream. HD does it again.
51_hd,5,5.0,1.0,I only can find one of a grocery sell this ruby flavor ice cream It’s become one my favorite Haagen daze ice cream. I love ruby chocolate and it naturally has the ruby color and like a berry chocolate taste. This flavor is not too sweet. Also the Pistachio enhance the flavor to be more high quality. I hope they can put it on their regular menu instead of limited edition
51_hd,5,3.0,0.0,my mom purchased this since we buy haagen-daz every week and it was a new flavor. my entire family loves it so much! its such a unique and delightful taste. i love how its not too sweet and doesnt leave my throat feeling like i ate too many sweets. please dont keep this flavor as a limited edition one
51_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I love trying interesting and unusual flavors so of course when this caught my eye I could not refuse but after one bite I was utterly and completely disappointed yet I kept eating it trying to figure out what exactly I was tasting and somehow hoping the flavor would grow on me but it just never did. The taste of the chocolate is pretty indescribable. There is an after taste of bitterness. Unfortunately I also purchased Ruby chocolate from a competitor and concluded the same that the taste is just down right terrible.
51_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"I love pistachio flavor but I can barely taste it in this. I was hoping for a blend of pistachio, cream, and cacao. The flavor is mostly cream and whatever ruby cacao is."
51_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"Yes, the texture is smooth and easy to devour. That being said, thats the only plus about this ice cream. The Ruby chocolate is sharp and overpowers everything in this concoction and looks like salami. Its also sour tasting, which for a chocolate is weird on its own. The pistachio is barely noticeable and the sweet cream just tastes like milk. If your craving ice cream, dont reach for this carton. Its a trap."
51_hd,1,2.0,0.0,The taste was just not what I was expecting. Maybe it was the cacao but I did not like this. And I usually love Haagen-daze.
51_hd,1,3.0,1.0,"I have enjoyed most of the Trio Crispy Layers flavors, but this one fell flat. The pistachio tasted ""off"", and I think I am just not a fan of Ruby Cacao. I was hoping for an elegant treat, but this combination was not at all enjoyable."
51_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"I thought the texture was watery, the taste was weird - I could barely distinguish the pistachio and the sweet cream layers, and they both tasted very strange. The ruby cacao only adds to the confused flavor. I really thought this was just a complex flavor in the first spoonfuls, then I came to realize it really did taste kind of sour and bitter in a very convoluted way. That is, it was just bad."
51_hd,5,1.0,0.0,So good! I wasn’t expecting much but tried the ruby cacao bars previously and liked them but nothing special. I do love pistachio so I gave it a try and have since purchased 4 more times! It’s a problem! All the flavors together are just special. Can’t get enough. Just try it. Someone will love it!
51_hd,2,2.0,1.0,"I love the pistachio and sweet cream, but the red cocoa crisp is horrible. It tasted like melted Wiltons candy melts and has an absolutely terrible taste. I bought it because my grocery store didn’t have the coconut (my fav). But anyways, yucky."
51_hd,1,2.0,1.0,I thought this flavor was terrible and I was extremely disappointed. The pistachio flavor was very bitter and artificial. The ruby cacao had no flavor at all. I took a couple of bites and passed it to my dinner date who concurred. We tossed it.
51_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is so good!!! Please keep this flavor, I’m already addicted...can’t believe it’s limited edition. You need to keep this as a regular flavor! Perfect blend of flavors"

52_hd,4,35.0,1.0,"After reading a few of the reviews from others , Im confused...I was almost positive the recipe for rum raisin had been changed.. the rum flavor is all but gone. You could have knocked me over with a feather after seeing you tell others it hasnt . Ive been eating rum raisin ice cream since 1985 and its always had the same great flavor , but in the last years , that has changed. Its just not the same anymore..this used to be my favorite and Id eat nothing else (ice cream related) but Ive not eaten as much since it changed. I wish you could tell me what happened....and why is it so hard to find ?"
52_hd,1,19.0,3.0,"Your rum raisin ice cream has always been my ""hands down favorite"". But a few months ago I couldnt find it in any of the stores that used to carry it. Finally this last weekend I noticed it was back in stock at my local grocery so I bought some & couldnt wait to taste the creamy vanilla deliciousness and the plump rum soaked raisins. But the raisins were small, and definitely not plump and definitely not tasting of rum. In fact, there was only a hint of rum in the ice cream, almost as if a drop or two of rum extract was used as flavoring instead of the real rum. What happened? Please bring back the ice cream I remember."
52_hd,2,3.0,0.0,"Me and my Pap were always HUGE fans of rum raisin ice cream. It’s the only ice cream he likes to eat really, and he loves it. Nothing makes him happier. For well over 20 years he’s been loving the taste—until recently. He says it doesn’t taste the same, and it seems like this comment section agrees. Before the change, you used to get hit with a sweet mist of rum serenading you the moment you open the jar. Now, you get a slight reminisce of rum—the star of the show is now subpar. It’s disappointing honestly. PLEASE FIX THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I don’t mind the price if the taste is right."
52_hd,2,24.0,4.0,"I recently went on a search for a pint of my favorite HD flavor....RUM RAISIN (which I hadnt eaten in quite awhile due to health)...and was totally disappointed! The complete product was horrible! It lacked the richness and crankiness of what Ive known for decades. And PLEASE lets not real about the RUM and RAISIN part! I couldnt taste that classic Rum flavor with that LIL buzz which made me so happy to dig into! WHAT HAPPENED? Being a foodie with a big following, Im ready to blow the trumpet on this one! I refused to spend another $6 just to check if I had a bad batch! PLEASE FIX IT!"
52_hd,1,16.0,0.0,"For many years this was a favorite, but it disappeared for a while, then reappeared to my great excitement. Was followed by great disappointment in the lack of the old familiar rum flavor. I drown it in caramel sauce these days. Why would you change a popular classic? I stopped buying it, but still weaken every once in a while and try it again, hoping it will be better this time. It still isn’t. Will not buy again until I see the words “original recipe” on it. Please, please bring it back!"

52_hd,1,14.0,0.0,"Häagen-Dazs describe this product as “Rum Raisin”. A more appropriate product name would be “Creamy Raisin”, as I could not taste any trace of Rum whatsoever. I wonder if this is because I purchased the product in America, where alcohol is still prohibited for anyone under 21. I will be making an official complaint to Häagen-Dazs/ Nestle, as I feel duped with the miss leading product name."

I assume that someone got upright about alcohol being in ice cream and made you water it down and remove all the rum flavor. PLEASE, PLEASE, bring back your original recipe!!! I will most likely stop buying it now, as it just tastes like vanilla ice cream with a few raisins in it. So sad that this iconic flavor got ruined...."
52_hd,1,9.0,0.0,Today I purchased Haagen-Dazs rum raisin ice cream from our local Safeway store and was very unhappy when iI opened this....there were maybe “5” raisins in this container. OMG! Are you kidding me?!
52_hd,1,5.0,0.0,I’m glad to see I’m not the only one I haven’t indulged for years. But got a craving as this was my go to flavor & brand. It taste like vanilla ice cream with raisins no RUM at all. Something had to change! Does this have anything to do with cutting costs as you’ve come out with other spirit flavors?? I only had a little bit as I don’t even want to waste the calories on the rest of this tasteless ice cream.
52_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Hi folks, our whole family is addicted to fine ice cream and we favour HD over any other brand available in Germany, Swiss, Austria and Italy since it is available here (we loved the HD shop in Munich, Leopoldstreet and were there at least once a week, but it closed down..no other one in whole Munich. When this happened, my wife lost her only source of the beloved Rum Raisin flavour, because we cant even get it from Amazon fresh over here. Please, change or not, bring it (back) to German customers at least via Amazon."

The container I had today had raisins with a small amount of rum flavoring, not like it used to have. The ice cream was vanilla! No rum flavoring. Until you can honestly tell us what you did and that you have returned it to its original taste I am done with Haagen Dazs. Dont waste your time telling me you didnt change anything because we all know better."
52_hd,1,5.0,0.0,"I love ice cream. especially rum & raisin. im not saying Im an expert, but it is my ""go to"" flavour on every British seaside holiday. I remember a time when it was more popular, and as a child, choc ices were available with this simple and sublime flavour. Ah, that sweet pop as you chew into a rum-soaked raisin (ok, perhaps flavoured). But, much like avocado bathroom suites and bubble perms it fell from grace. Now, we are overwhelmed with salted caramel and cookie doughs - dont get me wrong, I love these too - but there is no room on the supermarket shelves for my old friend. Or so I thought! I was so excited to see my favourite brand of ice cream had resurrected my favourite flavour! What could possibly go wrong? Well, Ill tell you what.... the bod in charge of the rum is secretly drinking it and replacing it with cold tea. The raisins were lovely raisins, but that was it. There was maybe a whisper on the wind of the memory of rum long forgotten, but you had to really BELIEVE it was present. I am weeping for this masquerade. Let us leave its memory intact and cease this farce. It is a poor facsimile."

52_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"In the late 70’s, Rum raisin captured my heart, palette and loyalty. It was my ultimate luxury flavor . I’ve enjoyed the cherry vanilla mas well, however the virtual neutering of the glorious, complex rum raisin flavor has broken my will. I will miss you Haagen Daz, if you ever come back, I will join you. My loss is palpable, the memories , sweet and vivid. Please come back to me."
52_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Rum Raisin has been my favorite ice cream flavor ever since Häagen-Dazs put in on the American market. Despite what the company says, the recipe has obviously changed, and not for the better. As other reviewers have said, the rum flavor is hardly noticeable at all, and It is blander, tasting more like Vanilla Raisin. It’s s very disappointing change for Rum Raisin lovers."
52_hd,2,2.0,0.0,HD rum raisin has been my all time favorite since I was in high school ( many years ago) but last time I had it the raisins were not plump and the rum flavor was lacking. I did not enjoy it at all. Recently I thought I would try again and thought maybe I just got a bad one last time but now I searched stores everywhere and cant find it at all but many new flavors that I dont even want to try. So I bought an ice cream maker and am going to try making my own.
52_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"Id heard great things about rum raisin ice cream, so I finally picked up a pint, only to discover that it tastes like plain cream and sugar. Im not even sure I can tell if theres any rum flavor in the raisins."
52_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"You have not lived life unless youve tasted Rum Raisin. This delicacy wont usually be found in supermarkets showing how rare it is to experience a flavor so rich and decadent. This ice cream will take your taste buds on a journey unparalleled by any other ice cream. You will ride on the sweet but smooth flavor of rum whilst biting into bursts of sweetness called raisins. If youve never tried Rum Raisin, bless your self and eat this as soon as possible."
52_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"They say the recipe is the same, but you aren’t fooling everyone. Something is drastically different. Which MBA decided to save a nickel and ruin my favorite iced cream? I can’t taste the rum. It’s like sugar cream and plain raisins."
52_hd,5,2.0,0.0,Haagen Dazs rum raisin symbolizes heaven in a cup! The creamy mouthfeel and exceptional flavor profile is a gift to anyone that cares about food. I hope they do not cave in the future and start putting in low quality ingredients like everyone else does. Charge more for your product if necessary but please do not change your core values on creating exceptional ice cream. Keep up the good work!
52_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"In 1979 I was 22 living in NYC. I met a beautiful red headed Irish girl, her name was Carol. We went out for dessert one night and she insisted I try rum raisin. I remember her closing her eyes with the first spoonful and saying mmm! A year later I she died in a car crash in a wedding party en route to the reception. Every now and then I buy rum raisin and remember her, the wonderful person, the sweet young girl whose life was cut too short! This Haggen-daz has changed, Ill never buy again."
52_hd,3,2.0,0.0,The rum raisin has been my absolute favorite flavor for years. The new recipe is very disappointing. It has no rum flavor at all. It is watered down and tastes more like cream than actual rum. Why would you change something so good? It is like you are lowering your standards.
52_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I’m sad that this flavor is no longer on Safeway shelves, but glad it’s at Fred Meyer. Please never discontinue this flavor and please do advocate to get it back. Also - ever consider doing a boozy ice cream line? I love it as is but alcoholic rum raisin sounds amazing."
52_hd,5,3.0,1.0,"It has a unique flavor, but it tastes good. When you eat it with a friend it tastes even better! Me and my friends have a good time eating this in our after school club. That its self is a comforting flavor."
52_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"For years, we have always savored our Rum and Raisin Haagen-Dazs. Recently, we got four tubs of this new packaging. They are virtually tasteless. So much for a reputation and tradition that has ended down the drain. This will take years to recover if ever! The bad taste will live long before any revival takes effect."
52_hd,1,2.0,1.0,The new recipe is terrible! It tastes nothing like rum. I was so taken back by the taste that I rechecked the container to see if I purchased a low fat version. It tastes like frozen ice sugar slushy. I will NOT purchase again and will return the one I purchased. Go back to the original recipe PLEASE!
52_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"This and the Coffee flavor have been my absolute favorite for years. This new (no egg? No cream?) recipe is watered-down, has no lingering flavor and there is a bit of bitterness in the after-taste. Very ""cheap"" tasting. This was the only ice cream brand I consumed, will not be purchasing anymore."
52_hd,2,1.0,0.0,Run Raisin has always been my favorite. Something has changed as there is no more rum flavor. Tastes like vanilla with some raisins added. Also didnt like the change to 14 oz. but keeping the same price. Recently switched to Wegmans Rum Raisin. So much better and still a full pint.
52_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"This review is based on Haagen-Dazs Rum Raisin being my favorite indulgence since the early 80’s. My children recall our vacationing food supplies being purchased from the store that sold this brand and flavor of ice cream. There has been a dramatic change in flavor over the past few years that continues to result in less pleasing taste. I have remained hopeful and willing to try “just one more time” at least once every 3-4 months, making purchases in different localities in hopes that maybe that batch was the issue. But to no avail..... Today’s purchase was even more disappointing! The flavor is weak and definitely not worth sacrificing for! I am now looking to the local ice creameries who make specialty flavors, including rum raisin, to support. Please keep me, and your other loyal supporters who have left honest reviews, up to date as to changes to bring the original Rum Raisin flavor intensity back in to your product line. Until then, i will not waste my time searching for my previous favorite brand and flavor; or spend any more money to continue being disappointed."
52_hd,5,1.0,0.0,the best ice cream of all time. every time we think about dessert always come to mind this ice cream not only my husband and I love it also my parents sisters and husband. please dont stop making this ice cream.
52_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"My all time favorite us rum raisin and i hope to find it in my grocery stores. Right now, it is difficult to find and hope more large grocery stores start carrying it again. Rum raisin is my favorite."

53_hd,5,10.0,0.0,"I hardly EVER leave reviews and didnt plan on leaving one now, but I knew this flavor deserved it because here I am searching for where i can find more of it. Best flavor you guys have ever come up with next to Caramel Cone. I have to literally tell myself to not finish it in one sitting and I never get it right. My local store ran out and I havent found another one with them yet. I even have my girlfriend checking stores for it when she goes in. Please help a brother out. 10/10"
53_hd,5,9.0,0.0,"The first time I bought it at a western beef I was very surprised and I instantly grabbed it. Tell me why I ended up at the same place same time the following day to buy the 3 for 12 deal that they had. I’m sure no more details are needed. It’s just unfortunate that I don’t know what places really have them on the list. I’ve been to a few and I have yet only been able to find it at the first place I bought it at, Western beef. If anyone could inform me on places to find it in Queens or Brooklyn that would be great!!! Please don’t take this flavor away!!!"
53_hd,3,4.0,3.0,But I didn’t.
53_hd,5,12.0,0.0,"My supermarket was out of rum and raisin and my eyes caught this flavor. I have never had an entire container at one sitting but...this flavor.....won me over. Wish there was a more stronger taste of the rum though. I drove over 10 miles to find this flavor again, Im hooked."
53_hd,5,10.0,0.0,"Rum Raisin Hagen Daz has been a favorite of mine for longer than I care to admit. This is very similar, as far as the base of the ice cream, but in lieu of raisins, you have yummy piece of tres leches cake. My partner bought us a pint last night, and while it he said it was too ""boozy""; I was utterly delighted."
53_hd,5,3.0,0.0,This is the best haagen dazs flavor Ive had so far. I love the taste of rum it would definitely taste good as a spiked milkshake! I love the taste of the cake. Overall this is a really good combo of flavors and I cant wait to taste the rest!
53_hd,5,3.0,0.0,Was excited to find the new Spirits collection at my local store. This is just scrummy!! While it doesnt remind me of Tres Leches at all it is still delicious. Now please bring the Vodka Key Lime to the States PLEASE!!
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I dont much care for sweets, never have, but Im on rare occasion I get a hankering and deep into the summer something cold is always welcome... Id bathe in this. The good hit of rum flavor along with the mellowing cake make sure the ice cream isnt cloyingly sweet. That the ice cream isnt overly dense but rather delicate and perhaps helped again by the rum make for a dessert that doesnt leave you with that unpleasant milk mouth. This is really great stuff, hope it sticks around."
53_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I bought this one just to see how the flavors will be with the tres leche and rum together, and boy ohh boy, am hooked now and not only me but my peeps at work too, I have them hook to this ice cream, to whoever discover this flavor, you knocked the ball out of the park. Thank you so much. We at the Courtyard by Marriott family really appreciate it."
53_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I am obsessed with this flavor! After reading the ingredients list I was pleasantly surprised that it does not contain carrageenan, an ingredient used by most ice cream makers. The texture and flavor are amazing! Thank you for coming up with this linr!"
53_hd,5,2.0,1.0,This ice cream takes all my sorrows away. My taste-buds said hallelujah thank you Jesus. Ive tried 4 out of the 6 flavors in the spirits collection and this one along with the 2 Bourbon flavors are my absolute favorite. The alcohol content is bold and marries well with the ice cream. In my opinion you can discontinue rum and raisin and replace it with the rum tres leches because you hardly taste the rum in the rum and raisin flavor. I hope this spirits collection is a permanent fixture and not a limited edition. Ive hooked all my friends onto these flavors as well and they all texted me blissful messages about the tres leches and bourbon flavors. We are pleased Indeed. Carry on with the alcohol ice cream concoctions. The genius creator behind these flavors needs and deserves stock options and a ginormous bonus because they did that well!!
53_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"Flavor was spot on, however the base contained ice Crystals in every bite. It was more like ice milk rather than ice cream. My husband had the stout pretzel and it was amazing."
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I 100% believe this ice cream is the reason Fidel Castro was obsessed, this ice cream could solve world peace, if this ice cream wasnt 920 calories Id be eating it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This taste like sweet childhood memories, this ice cream tastes like the cup cake phase in a relationship. 10/10 would recommend on amazon. But in all seriousness what is the rum in this ice cream? captain morgan or bacardi?"
53_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I like it! I like it very much! Its my favorite. So delicious and sweet!! With little delicate biscuits and rum. Very good. Thank you for this ice cream.
53_hd,5,2.0,0.0,I was pleasantly surprised about this flavor. It made up for the horrible vanilla ice cream you now have.
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I’m massive fan of Haagen Dazs to begin with - I only buy their ice cream. I saw this and was super intrigued. Omg it did not disappoint. Creamy and decadent with small bits of cake, truly what heaven must taste like if you licked it. Reminds me of home and available in the Midwest. ❤️"
53_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"Great product!! Ice cream was decadent with a nice mild (please keep in mind its still an ice cream not a bottle of rum) rum taste, the only thing that kept me from 5 stars was that it didnt have much of the cake in it."
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I love rum raisin and this line is my favorite. Is like eating a tresleche icecream cake with extra Kick. I love it! Too bad is a bit difficult to find in my nearest supermarkets. I reccomend it 100%
53_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"Try this flavour, but very disappointed, very mild flavour of rum, tres leches or dulce de leche, almost no chunks or ribbons. Taste more like a very plain vanilla ice cream."
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I can’t stop eating it is so delicious it has a taste of rum and the chunks of cake just goes so well with it ... never get rid of this flavor so yummy Thank you Haagen Dazs
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Haagen-dazs-Rum Tres Leches tastes so good! Best flavor, amazing texture, superb ingredients and ultra rich! I also love that it is sealed for safety..."
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor is so good!! Love the cake chunks in it :D And the rum is not overpowering. Well balanced flavor. A new favorite for us (:
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Pleasantly surprised. I absolutely love this product. I wanted more after finishing the container. I will definitely buy this again!
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This was by far the best ice cream flavor I have had. We loved it so much we went back to store the next day for more
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"It was evenly balanced in Flavor, & Ingredients."
53_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"Love the new flavor, it’s my new favorite. I’m always trying to find it cause it’s never on the shelves."

53_hd,2,1.0,0.0,Stuff tastes like caramel nail polish.
53_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is now my favorite pint. Perfect combination!
54_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"I am loving this flavor! I really dont understand the bad reviews. I personally like that the salted flavor doesnt overpower the other flavors. Also, for the people complaining about the ice texture thats just because at some point it was thawed too long and then refrozen. I would take those back to the stores where they came from as I would think that happened at some point in the transport to the store. My store has a satisfaction guarantee on all the products they sell. I think this is the best flavor Ive tried so far. Im guessing that other people think so too as this is always the flavor that sells out first whenever it is on sale."
54_hd,5,9.0,1.0,"This is my absolute favorite ice cream. I dont normally eat Häagen-Dazs, but decided to try it because there was a sale & I love chocolate with salted caramel. I see some reviews say its bland & not salty enough, but I dont agree. I love that the caramel isnt overly salty & I think the flavors blend well with each other. I can taste the difference between the 2 ice cream flavors. I love the smooth taste of the caramel ice cream, I would eat it by itself & I usually only like salted caramel when its paired with chocolate. I like how the crispy layers are spread out so you get to enjoy just the ice cream for a few bites. Im addicted & hope this flavor stays."
54_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I almost ate the whole pint. It was the best, most unexpected part of my day. The ice cream itself was velvety in a different way than most ice cream is. The chocolate and salted caramel ice cream together is such a classic pairing, but what marries the two together to make a stellar ice cream was the thin, crisp Belgian chocolate. Its not like the chunks of chocolate you get in some ice cream, this is a delicately combined crisp chocolate ribbon that gives the slightest crunch. This was heaven."
54_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"Absolutely YUMMY! Haagen Daz’s Signature creamy, smooth ice cream with the PERFECT amount of Salted Caramel Ribbons throughout. I LOVE this ice cream in Affogato. A touch of your favorite alcohol for that extra special touch."
54_hd,5,4.0,0.0,This is pure candy ice cream indulgence! World class hard chocolate with ice cream! Hot flavor! 5 stars of satisfaction! The decadence is non stop because the chocolate crispy never ends! I finished the pint. in 3 tries.
54_hd,5,3.0,1.0,I was craving ice cream and wanted to try this out. It exceeded all my expectations. I never write reviews unless I am forced to. But this ice cream is so good I voluntarily looked up the website to do so.
54_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"Im agreeing with most on here. I tried salted caramel and chocolate. It tasted like ice milk or weird diet ice cream. I thought maybe I got a bad one that had been melted and refrozen. I will try again because I want this to be wonderful, but only one more try...."
54_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"I agree with all the other more negative reviews... it tasted like it was refrozen. My first thought was “wow, i picked the one that had freezer burn”, but it now it just seems like that’s just the flavor. Haagen dazs, you really let me down home-skillet."
54_hd,1,1.0,0.0,Bought this ice cream and hated the taste completely. I’m an ice cream lover but not this flavor at all. Please Haagen Dazs go back to making “ “ SEA SALT CARAMEL TRUFFLE “ instead of this “SALTED CARAMEL TRIO “
54_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"This had the mouthfeel of ice milk, not premium ice cream. Also, both the chocolate and caramel were bland. Very surprised and disappointed because Im usually a fan."
54_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"I agree with another reviewer who said it was more like ice milk than ice cream. Poor texture, not much taste. I will not be buying again."
55_hd,5,6.0,3.0,I tried a lot of ice cream. I loved this one. It does not have huge piece of strawberry. It was well blended .The strawberry flavor is the best. I got the 14oz and we finished it at a sitting. My kids and hubby were asking for more. Its actually on my grocery list. I think I found a brand that the family agrees with. I will highly recommend it to anyone.
55_hd,5,7.0,1.0,"This is super tasting ice cream. It has all the ingredients that I would use if I was making my own. Cream, skim milk, strawberries, cane sugar and egg yolks. No GMO ingredients and gluten free. It tastes very creamy and just the right amount of everything. I love this ice cream."
55_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"This was my first experience with the Strawberry variety of Haagen-dazs ice cream. Previously, I had tried only the vanilla and rum raisin flavors. ALL are delicious! Maybe its because Summer just began and I am feeling nostalgic, but this strawberry ice cream was really amazing! Just the right amount of strawberries too... You can actually taste the cream and real sugar in this ice cream. There is a reason that its so expensive, folks. The quality is unmatched and the care taken with this brand comes shining through in every single bite. A true pleasure from start to finish. Please go get some! Youre gonna love it!"
55_hd,5,4.0,1.0,"The Strawberry ice cream was definitely a winner at our house! It has chunks of strawberries and a real pleasing taste. Smooth and creamy, just the way ice cream should be. My son and I shared this and even he said is was one of the better ice creams hed had. Will tell everyone I know to try it!"
55_hd,4,8.0,4.0,"great flavor but some reviewers are misled. they think bc this ice cream is not pink that its only real strawberries but its quite the contrary. if you have ever made homemade ice cream you know that you roughly puree the strawberries then add to the milk/cream. the mixture becomes intensely pink. commercial ice cream companies use strawberry flavoring, yes haagen das uses natural flavoring but its flavoring not fresh berries. then they throw in a few actual strawberries. that is also why its the same all year around. so thats that. the ice cream is great and nothing wrong with using natural flavoring for consistency. just wanted people to know the facts."
55_hd,5,3.0,0.0,I just bought the strawberry Haagen-dazs. We had some for dessert tonight. This has to be my favorite strawberry icecream from the store. Its so creamy and packed with real strawberries. Not an artificial taste by no means. It was so easy to scoop out unlike some icecream that bend a spoon. We literally ate the entire pint tonight! The texture was perfect as well as the taste. Im going to get more tomorrow. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a great icecream!
55_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I recently went to the grocery store to take advantage of a Haagen-daze ice cream sale, but unfortunately a lot of other ice cream lovers must have had the same idea. There weren’t many flavors left to chose from and to my greatest disappointment— no mango (my all time favorite). So I purchased the few that were left—including what I heretofore regarded as the lowly strawberry flavor. After all I thought that simple strawberry was not really exotic enough compared to HD’s other fabulous flavors. It was like having an epiphany! It was the most delicious strawberry ice cream that I had ever tasted and from now on, I will be adding it to my favorite flavors purchase list. Thanks Haagen-dazs!!"
55_hd,5,2.0,0.0,The strawberry ice cream is by far my favorite flavor Häagen-Dazs makes! It’s very creamy and I always get pieces of strawberry chunks in every bite! The ice cream has a nice sweetness to it that doesn’t taste artificial. I feel confident in knowing that I am getting the best ingredients.
55_hd,5,3.0,2.0,"I have never tried Haagen dazs before, but this is the best ice cream ever! They have so many flavors to choose from. I cant wait to try them all. The strawberry flavor had chunks of strawberries, and was so creamy. I loved that there were only 6 ingredients, so I felt tyhat this brand was more natural than any other brand. I will be buying this again for sure."
55_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Almost every Time I went to the Supermarket in my area to purchase the individual size n most of the time the pint, this flavor was gone while others were still there. It is how Ice Cream should be made. My father used to make Vanilla Bean Ice Cream from scratch using the old brown bucket with the churn on top, the best tasting ice cream I had coming up. He always told me as a youth Haugen Daz was 1 of the best if I was going to buy ice cream. I did not care for the flavors like Coffee, Vanilla or Chocolate plus I like 5 Real Natural Ingrediants not the artificial in my food, drinks or ice cream."
55_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I have to admit! I’m addicted to strawberry Haagen Dazs (no joke) I noticed I was eating too much of it that I eat 14oz 3-4 times a day for lunch. I love the creaminess , the not so sweet flavor, the fat that you know isn’t the best for your health but makes me feel joy and happiness. I try to buy them on deals but still it’s about $17 weekly but better than my previous months costs of weekly $30ish, monthly $120. But honestly, this strawberry flavor brings me back childhood great memories. Even after eatjnh these many pints of strawberry icecream, I still every time feel the “icecream high” and happiness eating this. It is my must desert. Thank you for making our lives better .. it’s just icecream but it matters..."
55_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Strawberry is not my favorite flavor but I DO appreciate that there are no fillers, gums or.stabilizers just pure (5) ingredients. Yay!"
55_hd,4,3.0,0.0,I bought a pint of your strawberry today and there is a weird texture to it. Like the sugar didnt dissolve all the way a left a gritty feeling in my mouth as well as my husbands and you could feel it as we swallowed it. Im still a fan but maybe it was a batch problem. Either way something to look into but great ice cream either way.
55_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Häagen-Dazs Strawberry ice is the best strawberry ice cream. No artificial pink color just just homemade goodness! Perfect creamy, rich and fresh strawberries throughout. It needed to be comercialed its the best darn strawberry ice in the land and I stand behind it."
55_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Absolutely love this ice cream and the real chunks of strawberry make it extra special.Unfortunately no longer seems to be available in the uk in this original flavour only strawberry and cream which although very good is no substitute for the original.
55_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"Strawberry used to be loaded with strawberry pieces, then about a year ago, it became less and seems to be getting less and less. Why did you stop adding alot of strawberry pieces?"

56_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"The original strawberry has always been my favorite. I’m excited to have it as an option with less sugar. It’s slightly “fluffier” In texture, but tastes almost exactly like the original. As for the waffle cone pieces, I wish they were slightly bigger. I am not a fan of chocolate with fruit, so I personally would prefer a plain waffle cone."
56_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Well I am a huge Häagen-Dazs lover and I loved the light ice cream better than the others I’ve tried. Though lite, it still tasted like I was eating the regular Strawberry Häagen-Dazs ice cream except with chocolate waffle cone pieces."
56_hd,5,2.0,1.0,"Always looking for smart ways to enjoy sweet treats and Haagen daz you really crushed this one. My boyfriend and I took a whole pint of this down in like 10 minutes. It was so good. As someone who tracks my calories too this definitely is a macro friendly option. I personally think this tastes A LOT more like real ice cream than halo top. Best part, it’s guilt free."
56_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"Great strawberry flavor of the ice cream, good texture, and a break from other low-cal ice creams that don’t have a lot of fruit options. That said, the strawberries were almost gummy and the chocolate covered waffle cone pieces were soggy. Probably won’t get this particular flavor again, but it isn’t bad. I just like others better (sea salt caramel is yummy)"
56_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Well I thought it was great. Best light ice cream I have ever eaten. But, please bring back deep chocolate peanut butter swirl I miss it so much. Those were the good old days. Haha."
56_hd,3,1.0,0.0,This ice cream would of been great if the waffle cone pieces didnt tatse like stale wet cone pieces that has been sitting around the counter for a few days.
56_hd,3,1.0,0.0,Strawberry icecream was very refreshing. I was disappointed that the waffle chips werent hard. I was hoping for a nice crunch but it wasnt there.
57_hd,5,11.0,1.0,"I was never a huge ice cream lover. I probably had ice cream like once every year; maybe once every 2 years. It just wasnt my favorite. That is until I tried Haagen Dazs TRIO, White & Milk Chocolate. Im so obsessed with the flavor and the texture. Eating this ice cream is like an experience for me. I love the cracking sounds of the thin layers of chocolate. I never thought Id be willing to spend so much money on ice cream!!!! Ice cream...I mean its not cheap. But I have to admit (a bit shamefully) Im a bit obsessed. Im on my way to grab some now!!!! Uuuggghhhh....I need help. Maybe a hypnotist can break this habit? Rehab?"
57_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"I usually keep a tub of HD Coffee flavor in the freezer for my ice cream fix and just discovered this TRIO Belgian Choc w/White and Milk the other day. I have to say my tongue was still trying to figure out what I hit it with two hours later and I was still tasting it the next morning. Wow. I didnt think the Belgian would let you taste the white chocolate at all (and never had white chocolate ice cream before) and it does hide it a bit, but when you find the white its like a sweet prize. Most awesome ice cream ever. Dont ever quit making this one!"
57_hd,5,5.0,0.0,I’ve been trying to find a new ice cream because I was tired of the same one I was eating. One day I saw this one and was like hmmm I love chocolate and white chocolate so let’s give it a try. The first bite was amazingly delicious and the fact that there’s chocolate pieces in it gives it that extra crunch. It’s sooooo good. If you love chocolate this is your new favorite ice cream. THANK YOU HAAGEN-DAZS for this new amazing ice cream :)
57_hd,4,3.0,0.0,This ice cream is so good! I wish I could taste the white chocolate a little more thats my favorite! But over this ice cream is amazing!
57_hd,1,6.0,3.0,Not very good. The texture lacked creaminess and the product tasted almost like chocolate flavored ice water. I had one bowl and threw out the rest.
57_hd,3,2.0,1.0,"As a fudge swirl rather than a chocolate shell. While I normally chew my ice cream, I dont expect to when I pick up something that says triple chocolate. I feel sorry for the people that normally dont. I think my jaw got a workout. The shell is just too overpowering as it is, and masks the other chocolate flavors. I was really disappointed. This sounded amazing."

57_hd,2,1.0,0.0,I do not enjoy the version with 30% more chocolate. This addition of more chocolate throws the proportion of ice cream to chocolate off. Can you make the original available too?
57_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"Even triple chocolate, it is milder than regular chocolate flavor. I am a bit disappointed because the intensity of chocolate is not as strong as expected."

58_hd,5,18.0,1.0,"OMG! I noticed these at my local grocery store and picked up a box because they looked like the kind of ice cream bar I would create if I had my way at the Haagen Daz testing kitchen. After dinner, the night I bought these, I pulled one out of the freezer and after the first bite, I thought I died and gone to heaven! The chocolate coating is the perfect blend of milk and rich dark chocolate. The vanilla ice cream is smooth and works perfectly with the crunchy, rich chocolate cookie bottom. I love Haagen Daz vanilla or coffee ice cream bars dipped in chocolate, almond and toffee, but these are over the top! Its almost criminal to make something this good. I ate two in a row and had to write in to let everyone know about these heavenly delights."
58_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"Both I, my 7-year old son, and my husband LOVE these. In fact, they created some family strife, as my husband gobbled most of them up!

59_hd,1,292.0,23.0,"My husband and I have always loved, enjoyed, and been loyal to Haagen-Dazs, vanilla ice cream in particular. We went to Publix to get our usual (half a gallon!) tub earlier tonight. We first noticed that something was different - wrong - , when little black vanilla bean remnants were nowhere to be found. We immediately got a bad feeling. Then the taste. It is icier, less dense, and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. We are convinced that Haagen-Dazs did not change the recipe to make it better (because it was perfect), but rather to cut costs on ingredients. You have lost loyal customers of 30 years, because we will not buy it again."
59_hd,2,248.0,5.0,"Unfortunately, Im saying goodbye to my favourite ice cream brand. The last few months I noticed a change in the taste and texture of the Vanilla flavour: it was soft and had an almost artificial after taste. I came on the website to see if there was a change and after seeing the reviews I now understand they tweaked the formula in some critical way. My husband is an ice cream fiend and not very discerning when it comes to taste (he didnt mind eating these last pints), but as I do the shopping I only purchase Haagen-Dazs. I will now indulge him to other brands as I can no longer bare the taste of this new formula. Shame."
59_hd,1,259.0,5.0,"Up until today (July 27, 2018) Haagen Dazs made my favorite vanilla ice cream of all time! Whatever changes they recently made in the ice creams consistency and taste, made the the best ice cream ever into a bland vanilla flavored foam. I thought maybe the carton sat in my car too long before getting it into the freezer. But when googled it, I found that I am not the only one whos disappointed in the change. Why mess with perfection? I am so disappointed. Sadly, will not be purchasing it again. I havent tried any other flavors- I really hope that Haagen Dazs have not changed their recipe across the board."
59_hd,2,249.0,3.0,"I used to love the old vanilla recipe. It was creamy and dense and far superior to any other companys vanilla formula. Your recent changes have made it icier, less rich, and more like the moderate-quality vanilla ice creams that are widely available from other companies. PLEASE bring back the old recipe, or at least make both the old and new recipes available for those of us who yearn for the bygone era when your vanilla was the top choice by a wide margin. Im very discouraged by your companys decision to monkey with a time-tested formula that had separated you from the rest of the crowd."
59_hd,2,232.0,3.0,"Not sure what happened, but the last few times I noticed the ice cream was much softer than what it used to be. In the past it was hard to even get out a scoop, now it is soft when I grab it from the stores freezer to place in the shopping cart. At first I thought maybe the stores freezer isnt cold enough, but I have now purchased from 3 different places and it was too soft each time, not to mention out if my own freezer. What used to take forever to eat and enjoy is now gone in no time :( It seems like air has been added to make it softer (as many other cheaper brands do) and I do not enjoy this new softness. I also thought it was much sweeter than what I was used to. Please go back to the original formula!"
59_hd,1,224.0,2.0,The new recipe is gross. Can’t believe the price is the same and ingredients cut down. Permanent freezer burn consistency. Even the color is different. Big lossses to come due to changes.
59_hd,1,232.0,3.0,"For as long as I recall, Haagen-Dazs vanilla and chocolate ice cream were always my ice cream of choice. Im disappointed. The minute I tasted the ice cream I just bought I knew something was different. This ice cream is sugary, flat and without distinctive quality in taste. What happened to the rich, creamy, not so sweet, full flavored ice cream that lingered in ones mouth? I am reminded of Coca Cola and classic coke. Why change something that is already great? I am sad. I will have to start the arduous search for a replacement and Im not sure there is one."
59_hd,3,4.0,0.0,Im such a vanilla ice cream snob I thought I was being over critical of the last carton of Haagen Dazs vanilla I had. Haagen Dazs vanilla has been my go to ice cream for decades. It was the ice cream to compare all other to. But this batch was icy and not at all the Haagen Dazs I have enjoyed before. It all boils down to the corporate decision makers. How to increase profits. First change the container from 16oz to 14oz. Next lower the cream content and increase the milk. Both BAD decisions. I suppose they should be given credit for not adding an assortment of gum additives. Either way Haagen Dazs has lost me as a customer.
59_hd,1,145.0,0.0,"Vanilla is my favorite flavor, but I went on a diet for a little while. When I saw Haagen Dazs vanilla in the ice cream aisle, I couldnt help myself and splurged. I am extremely disappointed! It does not taste the same at all. Haagen Dazs ice cream used to be the best, regardless of the flavor. but now it tastes like milky unflavored water. The vanilla taste that I used to love so much is barely there. I can no longer justify the price of this ice cream. On to my next favorite ice cream brand."
59_hd,2,129.0,0.0,"I don’t often but ice cream, but when i do you can be sure it wil be haagen dazs. It’s rich and creamy texture and real vanilla taste, it is so good! But yesterday wasn’t the same. I was all excited to open my jar of ice cream and when i tasted it, i was so disappointed.there were no more creamy and rich texture, instead it was almost like i was eating frozen yogurt,not that i don’t like frozen yogurt but you know, it’s not haagen dazs."
59_hd,2,226.0,0.0,"I have always purchased your vanilla. Best anywhere. Not now. The texture is like ice milk and the flavor is weak and overly sweet. Feels lighter, no longer creamy and dense. It used to blow Ben and Kerrys away. Now the reverse is true. Is this another case of saving a few pennies, giving us less, but asking for more money? Skimp on the butterfat, add more air and sugar. See ya. Such a shame. Sign of the times."
59_hd,1,4.0,0.0,"Consumer since I was a child. My go-to vanilla ice cream for apple pie, brownies, cookies etc... I am so let down that I am writing this review at 11:32PM, after having chocolate cake with this vanilla ice cream. My mom mentioned it long ago that the flavor has changed, and wow, has it. Flaky, icy, borderline Bryers? Lacking in its creamy, velvety texture, that gives this wholesome taste of vanilla. The previously cream colored ice cream is now white and airy. Not as dense and rich. I will not be repurchasing. Trader Joes brand seems more doable or Ben & Jerrys Vanilla Bean. Please change the recipe back!"
59_hd,2,21.0,1.0,"I wanted to share my utter dismay with the changes you have made to your vanilla ice cream formula. It is icier and less creamy. The experience is significantly diluted from what it used to be. I am very disappointed that you made the changes, disappointed that you didnt bother to announce those changes to your customers, and disappointed in the end result. PLEASE consider returning to the old flavor OR - at the very least - provide both versions for those of us who are highly discouraged by the changes."
59_hd,1,15.0,0.0,"In San Fran Area last November 2017. At Joes market Oakland, got a quart of vanilla ice cream, and then also another store later, Berkeley Bowl. the first 2 tablespoons tasted like sandpaper!! with a lot of sugar. I thought it was a fluke, but when I got it later, I realized Haagen-Dazs decided to take all the cream and add more water, which does not change the ingredient list but! Gives a far more inferior product!! this ice cream was so nasty its like the ice milk, thats $2 a gallon cuz its mostly water sugar and artificial flavor; ice milk! This is such a terrible move on Nestles part! to scam the customer, charging high prices for nothing more than ice water. Very disappointing Ill never buy it sgain. Talenti ist way better, Stone Cold Creamery everywhere now, plus gelato we dont need this!"
59_hd,2,132.0,0.0,The most superior ice cream on the market is beyond disappointing. Bigger profits mean lower quality ingredients and smaller container size. The recipe has changed and definitely not for the better. Lack-lustre flavour and texture has lost its smoothness.
59_hd,1,129.0,1.0,The new recipe is awful. The taste has changed so much I will never consider buying it again. Your product was a great one. Why change it??? The new taste is icier and milky unlike the previous version that was smooth and creamy. Our family will not consume your brand anymore.
59_hd,3,19.0,0.0,"I had some surgery that made it impossible for me to eat much beyond protein shakes for the last year. Finally got to go ahead from my physician to eat a bit of ice cream. I was very disappointed in the product. It did not have the back notes of flavor ice come to life over the years, and instead of being the lovely treat I loved, it was a huge disappointment. I won’t be buying it again unless you return to your previous formula."

59_hd,1,132.0,0.0,"Despite the constant denials in the company responses in almost every (overwhelmingly negative) recent review being left here, the formula or manufacturing method clearly changed in the last few years. The consistency in the reviews and the multiple external websites mentioning it gives it away if the astounding drop in quality didnt already. What used to be an incredibly dense, firm, and delectably rich ice cream bursting with high quality vanilla flavour that actually required a few minutes to thaw to get to a good eating consistency is now nothing of the sort."
59_hd,1,13.0,0.0,"We used to buy ONLY Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for special occasions, because it was the best. It was dense and creamy and had a good vanilla flavor. It was a special treat that we could occasionally afford to splurge on. But the last time we got some we noticed the flavor was ""off"". Icy, milky, like its missing the cream or fat. We thought we just got a bad carton so we tried again. But its the same, definitely something is changed or something is wrong. Its icy, milky, thin - tastes generic. Dont know what you guys changed but we wont be buying Haagen-Dazs from now on thats for certain. Its nothing special anymore. And definitely not worth the price anymore. In fact our store brand tastes better and is much cheaper. Sorry but well be telephoning customer service about a refund, and youve lost a life time customer over this change."

Will be throwing the rest of the carton out and going for Breyers (costs less too). This is how you lose customers."

As a person who normally prefers more complex ice cream (ie brown flavors with mix ins), I was extremely impressed that Haagen Dazs was able to make even vanilla ice cream addicting--you couldnt help but going back for more. It was perfect with pie, fruit, or just on its own. If I had to pick only one ice cream to eat for the rest of my life, it would have been that one."

Bought a quart size of the vanilla ice cream for a special occasion (pairing with a chocolate cake), and everyone commented on the ice cream tasting different. More like frozen milk than the creamy Haagen Dazs we all knew. Just had one of the ice cream bars tonight and it just seems like a lower quality product than the past. The ice cream strangely seems to dissolve into pellets in the mouth rather than melting as any ice cream normally melts. Ive been reading some of the reviews here and keep seeing the company rep commenting ""rest assured we have not changed our recipe,"" but a quick bit of investigating will reveal that the recipe was altered in 2017. The same 5 ingredients are used, so they say, but the recipe was changed. What triggered this change is a mystery."

Finally I was so disappointed that I went on the website to see if there was a change. I’m actually saddened that you changed the formula. It was perfection before. Now it’s like any other brand. Your ice cream used to be the ice cream coniseur’s ice cream. I’ve been online trying to find your old recipe so I can duplicate it myself. Can you please share it with me? You list the same ingredients so I’m assuming you decreased the cream and the quality of the vanilla. I’ve been experimenting with different recipes.

Of course when it came down to the ice cream I had a few favorites, but I happen to notice the one I use to go to, product begins with the letter ""B"" in the Black Carton, has changed their ingredients and like most others has more chemicals in the ice cream than I care to eat. I research Haagen-dazs to see what their ingredients were for the Vanilla Ice Cream, and so pleasantly surprised to see they have not yet change and uses the 5 ingredients that I can read and can pronounce. Imagine that just 5 ingredients! Perhaps it has been a while since I had Haagen-Dazs ice cream, but from what I recently consumed was in my good and most satisfying."

I bought vanilla bean, chocolate peanut butter and chocolate. The vanilla was icy, lacked the vanilla flavor and creaminess. The chocolate peanut butter was okay, but I could tell that it wasnt the same as it used to be. The peanut butter pieces were gross. The chocolate was a huge disappointment. It didnt taste right. It didnt taste like pure chocolate and it was definitely not creamy. When I scooped some with a spoon, I noticed the texture was not smooth. The ingredients include skim milk and cane sugar!? The original didnt. Often, cane sugar has a distinct flavor. I only had a few spoons of each and let them defrost in the sink. I managed to get them on sale however, they were still expensive. I wont buy Haagen Dazs again until the premium original ice cream is stored in the containers. Bring back the original recipe and stop cutting back on quality ingredients for profits! How much money do these companies need?! Packages are getting smaller, ie., only 3 bars instead of 4 in a box of Haagen Dazs, prices increase and quality goes down the drain. Enough already."

The texture isn’t as creamy and the flavor is less appealing. . I hope that haagan dazs will reconsider their change."
59_hd,1,4.0,1.0,"I’m an avid pie maker, and for years I have refused to serve anything but Dazs with my pies. Now it is absolute junk. It seriously tastes like the giant plastic tub of ice cream from the warehouse stores that they served at ice cream socials in elementary school. Why not just apologize and change it back?"
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"After fond memories of this a few years ago, I decided to buy a few tubs last week, after recommending it to my father who needs to gain weight after an operation. He wasnt keen and I couldnt believe it. However, Ive just sat through a small bowl and wouldnt recommend it to my dog. Awful, synthetic aftertaste and none of the quality flavour that I remember."
59_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"My life, my childhood, all ripped away in a moment. Skim milk? What’s happening? Bring the old recipe back, I miss her, my family misses her, my coworkers miss her, my dog misses her. At least I know the truth now and that I am not in fact losing it. Hagz is still superior in my eyes but it’s just been hard after the receipt change. Cheers. #bringbackthefat2020"
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"to be honest i have never tried Haagen-dazs, i dont know y just never drew my attention but i am glad i did. Ice cream is very good, taste like a more premium taste, very creamy and very delicious. i love classic vanilla, especially when you add some chocolate like brownies or cookies. I give this ice cream a A+, will be buying more from now on."
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I have bought this ice cream before without a problem. The ice cream was a little melted by the time I got home, but firmed up once I put it in the freezer for 30 minutes. The texture was wonderful and the taste was out of this world. My store didnt have the flavor I was after, but that is okay. I would buy this ice cream again."
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this ice cream last week becaise ive had kids over this weekend at my house for a sleep over. After the dinner time ive served rootbeer floats for the desert and used this icecream to prepare it. Kids adored the vanilla flavors in their root beer and i will definetely buy it in the future.Highly recommend it.
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Haagen-dazs vanilla is one of the best ice creams that I ever tasted and Im serious the real ingredients makes it spectacular believe me this is my favorite by far I will definitely let my friends and family know how great this ice cream is Ive tried the chocolate and strawberry but the vanilla is outstanding
59_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"I always considered Haagen-Dazs a premium brand, so was extremely disappointed when I tasted the vanilla ice cream. It had an icy texture and reminded me of freezer burn. I checked the expiration date assuming it must be bad, but after reading reviews I see others experience the same. Disappointed."
59_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"Dont know what happened but this is not the same vanilla recipe. As others have pointed out, seems sweeter and less dense then before. Also, doesnt have the rich quality it did in the past. Lastly, the color is whiter then it used to be... I remember it having more yellow in the appearance."
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Having never tried Haagen-Dazs before, my first spoonful of their Vanilla was a pretty profound experience. It was so smooth and creamy, I could immediately tell it was of far superior quality than other supermarket brands. And to think it only costs a tiny bit extra. So much worth it."
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I recently received a free coupon to purchase some Haagen-dazs Vanilla Ice Cream. It was really good. You could taste the vanilla in every bite. It was really creamy and smooth. I enjoyed every bite. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves ice cream its very addicting!
59_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"I agree with those who say Haagen-Daz ice cream is not what it used to be. It definitely seems that they have added more air to their product, resulting a less than satisfactory product. No more Haagen-Daz for me until they switch back to their original ingredients and formula."
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Ok i got this and i absolutely love ice cream and its summer so ice cream in my house is a must. This ice cream was so good really taste like vanilla very creamy i love it. I even had to hide in my bathroom to eat it so my kids wouldnt see because they wouldve ate it all.
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,The flavor with this Vanilla ice cream is amazing. My daughter doesnt usually like vanilla but this ice cream she couldnt stop eating. It was cream but yet light and refreshing. The price is a great deal and I highly recommend. Give it a try you wont be disappointed.
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This vanilla is no plain vanilla! Rich real vanilla taste no fake taste here. This would be perfect in a coke or root beer float or it tastes great on its own without anything extra. Haagen Dazs is one of my favorite brands it’s always rich and creamy premium ice cream
59_hd,5,1.0,0.0,My family really liked Haagen-dazs Vanilla ice cream. This ice cream had a nice rich vanilla flavor. It was nice and smooth. There were very small dots of vanilla all through the Haagen-dazs Vanilla ice cream. This is one ice cream that will be a staple our freezer.
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I purchased Haagen Dazs vanilla and caramel cone ice cream and they both taste like a cheaper brand. They definitely do not have the same ingredients that I am accustomed to. I wish I knew the ice cream is different now because I wouldn’t have made the purchase.
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,This used to be my favorite. I’ve tried vanilla. Ran and Vanilla and neither taste like the old vanilla. What changed in the ingredients? You keep replying that something changed in 2018; what was it that changed then? i was a loyal customer for so long.....
59_hd,3,1.0,0.0,Your vanilla has always been my favorite but I took a break from ice cream. Then a year ago I started eating Ben & Jerry’s peanut butter cup. I got tired of that and went back your vanilla and it tastes off from what I remember. Did the formula change
59_hd,3,1.0,0.0,I have been eating Haagen Daz ice cream since 1979. My favorite flavor for years has been Vanilla. Our recent quart has a weird taste. Both my husband and I noticed it independently. Could you please explain what has changed?
59_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"Didnt really enjoy it compared to other brands of ice cream, it just didnt fit. The texture and balance of flavor and smoothness wasnt all that great to me. I felt like something was off or missing with the taste."
59_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"As I sat in watching my favorite TV, I popped open the vanilla ice cream only to be puzzled that something was amiss. It was too sweet, not as creamy and flavorful as I remembered it to be. disappointed."
59_hd,1,2.0,1.0,"You had the BEST ice cream ever, but since you changed the formula it is horrible. At the very least, offer both formulas and keep your old customers. On to Ben and Jerry’s!"
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"i am not happy with the new formula, i liked the old one better, does not taste like vanilla, very sugar, lots of sugar flavor, very sweet, had to go to dentist"
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"The old vanilla ice cream was far better than this new version, it tastes like a cheap alternative, what have you people done"
59_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"Wow, what happened? This is not he same vanilla ice cream that I have been buying for years."
60_hd,5,7.0,3.0,"I just got this from my local Giant. Due to COVID, so many things are sold out, and I was super lucky to find this. I was a bit unsure about how it would taste, so I only got one pack - I regret it. These bars are DELICIOUS. The slight bitterness against the creamy, sweet vanilla is divine. I wish these came in a larger pack honestly."
60_hd,5,7.0,2.0,Please never stop making these. OMG...my whole family is addicted!!! dont change a thing...PLEASE!!
60_hd,5,7.0,2.0,I am broke because of this I can’t stop buying them ❤️❤️
60_hd,5,2.0,0.0,These bars are AMAZING!! I remember when the original ice cream bars came in vanilla with milk chocolate and vanilla with dark chocolate....this is a BETTER version of that!! The softened chocolate on the outside doesn’t crumble and fall everywhere. The flavors are PERFECT!!
61_hd,5,6.0,2.0,"I have come to expect a certain amount of quality when purchasing Haagen Dazs ice cream and this vanilla bean is no exception. I absolutely love it, it is so creamy and delicious. Vanilla has always been my favorite ice cream flavor and Haagen Dazs elevated that to a whole new level with this product. It tastes so incredibly fresh and natural, no weird artificial vanilla extract aftertastes, just yummy vanilla flavor. The texture is like nothing i have ever experienced. It is a truly decadent treat, I would highly recommend for anyone that wants a delicious ice cream with natural ingredients. It is worth every single penny!"
61_hd,2,16.0,3.0,"Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream has been an American icon for generations. It’s in a select group of consumer products that people know, enjoy, and importantly, have come to rely on for its consistency. For decades, if you wanted to buy the best vanilla ice cream, you didn’t have to think about it. HD was it. Fads have come and gone, but vanilla was our rock. Sadly, the people now in charge at HD didn’t appreciate this. The vanilla is now more icy and milky, and has less vanilla flavor. The creamy quality is not the same. I honestly think the folks in charge underestimated their customers’ palates and emotional attachment to their product. Some things you just don’t mess with. Haagen Dazs vanilla is one of those things."
61_hd,2,12.0,1.0,"As others have noted, this new flavor is not the same as the old. Why? Haagen why? Please bring back the old rich tasting vanilla bean flavor back. This new one taste artificial and no longer has that unique vanilla been taste. I hate this one. And as a result I stopped buying it. In fact, this was such a huge disappointment I do not buy as much as my other flavors. We are slowly losing companies who will stick to high quality and premium foods no matter what. Oh well I guess I have to learn how to make my own ice cream! :("
61_hd,5,8.0,1.0,"I’m crazy about this ice cream. I was never even really into vanilla ice cream; I’d always thought it was boring. Then, I had a scoop of Haagen Daz Vanilla Bean on a brownie, and I haven’t looked back since. Now I eat it all by itself. The flavor is so deep and sharp, and then the creaminess comes behind it and softens it so that it sits mellow and sweet in the back of your throat. The perfume floats up into your nose and fills your head with a pretty vanilla cloud. It’s sooo nice. This really needs to be made available in the gallon tub. Like, seriously."
61_hd,5,8.0,0.0,"So for years, I was a chocolate person. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever crave vanilla. First, I always thought of vanilla as the un-flavor, like it wasn’t a flavor just the absence of any flavor. Oh, how young and naive I was! Now, I can’t get enough of it. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease several years ago and I struggled to find a great ice cream that was safe for me to eat. Then, I tried Haagen Daz Vanilla Bean. Lightly perfumed with vanilla scent, the rich addition of eggs and creamy goodness. If I’m not careful I’d go through two quarts a week. Only one problem - I can’t seem to find many places that sell the vanilla bean. Vanilla, yes. The bean version, not so much. And there is a slight difference. Both are amazing but the small addition of those tiny brown flecks seems to take it to “11”. Thank you Haagen Daz, for teaching me the wonders of vanilla!"
61_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"After not having eaten this flavor in a long time, I purchased it last week and thought my taste buds were off as I remembered it having a very strong vanilla bean flavor. After reading the reviews below, I realize they have changed the recipe and it tastes just like plain vanilla now, nothing special. It used to be superior to all the other VB ice creams out there, but not anymore."
61_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"I used to eat HD vanilla bean ice cream weekly. I mean I have friends that know me for always eating the stuff. This goes back a couple of decades. But a couple years ago a tasted a container and didnt like it. Thinking something was wrong with THAT pint, I bought another a few days later, and it was awful as well. I thought maybe my taste buds had changed. A couple months later I gave it another try, and I said something I thought I would NEVER say..... I said ""I think I am DONE with HD vanilla bean. I was convinced that just like you tried to sneak the shrinking ""pint"" size on us, you also snuck a recipe change. Well, time goes by and I had the craving today, so I decide to look up this topic, and BAMM!! It seems you did indeed change the recipe!!! Why would you do this!!! Your vanilla bean was perfect!! Was the change made to produce a cheaper product? You already shrunk the size though!! Listen to your customers!! Your loyal vanilla bean fans can taste the difference. Because of this, I have not bought this product since. I have found a brand that comes close to your original flavor, but their price is a couple of dollars more expensive.... and you know what..... I pay that price for the quality. I dont eat it as much, but I cant buy this new vanilla bean. I miss my HD vanilla bean!!"
61_hd,3,3.0,0.0,Im very disappointed. This is not the same Haagen Daz that I have come to know.
61_hd,1,6.0,3.0,"I used to love eating this vanilla ice-cream as a special treat, as it tasted amazing. However, when I ate this new receipe I was very, very disapoined. İt tastes of chemicals and cheap, rather than rich and creamy. I will not be buying this version again. Please revert back to the previous far superior and tasty receipe. Very disapointed Haagen-Dazs."
61_hd,2,4.0,1.0,"This is what happen when another company takes over the original one. Haagen Dazs Vanilla Bean use to be my favorite flavor, now they are flavored as their Nestle Dryers brand. Lots of sugar and no creamy flavor."
61_hd,2,2.0,0.0,I recently purchased a batch of the newly released vanilla bean but it does not taste the same.
61_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I really did enjoy this icecream though I cant say if I ever tried the ""original"" vanilla bean icecream everyone is talking about. I just wanted to comment on the trans-fat concern. I have no knowledge of their production practices however some trans-fat occurs naturally in some dairy (and meat) and Judging by the amount in this I would say they didnt add any trans fat, rather it is just the amount that occurs naturally in the cream/milk"
61_hd,2,2.0,0.0,Tastes no different than regular vanilla. Very diassapointed. Please bring back the previous vanilla bean as it was the best on the market. Not happy and wont buying the new VB again.
61_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"I used to love HD vanilla bean, something has changed and not for the better."
61_hd,1,3.0,1.0,I have bought this ice cream for several years and have been impressed by the real vanilla taste. The new flavour is very disappointing and not special at all. I will not be buying this again.
61_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I love to use Vanilla Bean ice cream as a topping on cold or heated frozen fruit (I like Welchs antioxidant blend). The deep vanilla flavor is so much better with the fruit than regular vanilla. I hope Haagen Dazs continues to make this flavor!
61_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Bought this ice cream for a after dinner treat. The container looked like real vanilla ice cream with the vanilla beans in it so it was appealing to the eye. This is probably one of the best and realest tasting vanilla ice creams I have tried.
61_hd,5,2.0,1.0,I love vanilla bean and this totally got my fix in. I love ice cream every bite and again. This helped with getting my craving gone. Yum yum yum. Would get again when i need more ice cream. And I suggest you get it
61_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"Was my husbands favorie, but this year he noticed there were no ""flecks of real vanilla beans"" in it. It was like regular vanilla. He still liked it, but missed finding those flecks."
61_hd,3,1.0,0.0,New brand of Vanilla Bean is not the same anymore. This one tastes like regular vanilla. Bring back the old flavor as this is the only one I buy. And I am not happy.
62_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"OMG!!!!! This Haagen Daz’s Trio is my FAVORITE!!!!! The combination of the blackberry and vanilla ice cream work harmoniously in flavor. The texture is like ALL of Häagen-Dazs Ice Creams’ smooth, creamy, the ideal amount of richness. This one has that extra SPECIAL TOUCH of HUGE PIECES of Delicious Dark Chocolate! Mmmmm.... Soooo YUMMY!!!! Tasty alone. As a simple Sundae with MORE Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream, Nuts if one likes it. But my favorite.... is in an Affogato with a touch of Brandy and a dollop of whipped cream."
62_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"Hands down this is the best trio of icecream Ive ever had! I love it so much I stock up on it, so I can have one every day. But this past weekend all the stores around me were out of that kind and it didnt look like they were getting that kind again cause they had different kinds in their spot, and I hope that isnt the case cause I will be so upset. Do NOT get rid of this kind, the only thing I would change about it is, the flavor of the blackberry, I would make it alittle , stronger, sometimes it is stronger, and believe me since I eat 1 maybe even 2 a.day I would know. I think it.should be stronger than the vanilla for sure, especially with that Belgium chocolate. I sure wish I had some now, Ive been deprived the last few days and I sure hope that Wal-Mart get more in. Anyways, if you havent tried it, you better cause its the best!!"
62_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I discovered this flavor because I will sometimes pick up an ice cream if I see a new flavor. I love blackberry and you usually dont see this in grocery store ice cream. The combo of the vanilla and blackberry is sublime. The chocolate crackle is amazing! It provides a perfect counterbalance to the creamy ice cream and I love the texture it provides. If I am going to treat myself, this would be my choice, hands down."
62_hd,5,3.0,0.0,During a hot day to refresh at work I dropped by my local Smart & Final and noticed this flavor. Was extremely nervous to try this flavor even though vanilla and black cherry are my favorite ice cream flavors and with chocolate I took the risk and bought it. It exceeded my expectations and Im so in love with this flavor. Please consider a bigger size. I always drop by hoping to find a bigger bucket but never find one ):
62_hd,5,3.0,0.0,"This is now one of my favorite ice creams that I wolfed down in 30 minutes. ALL OF IT. Now, I enjoy the perfect blend between blackberry and vanilla. It is a sweet perfection, just like the cherry vanilla hägen-dazs. oh sweet mama, there is no doubt that I will be going to my local gorcery store and buying the rest off the self of the freezer because I am selfish like that!"
62_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"This is hands down the best flavor in ice cream isle! I have to stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. The blackberry ice cream marries well with the vanilla and melts into creamy bliss in your mouth. Then the added suprise of thin crispy Belgium chocolate makes your taste buds explode! The chocolate is delicate, crispy, rich and delicious! Sadly, I am unable to find it in the supermarket and that is why I cant eat whole pint in one sitting. I dont know when or where I will be able to purchase again."
62_hd,2,4.0,2.0,I really wish HD would make a single flavor blackberry as that is what I was after. The vanilla didnt contribute much & the chocolate was annoying. Wouldve much preferred chocolate ribbons or chocolate cookie crumbles. Tried it once & once is enough.
62_hd,5,3.0,1.0,Loved this ice cream just the chocolate was not good in it. But I dealt with it because I loved the blackberry and vanilla. But now I cannot fondnit in a store to buy.
62_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"Was really hoping for a strong blackberry taste, tasted more like the idea of blackberry or if someone who never had blackberries tried to make a blackberry flavor. Chocolate is very overpowering. Overall disappointed in my purchase and will not finish the carton"
62_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"Without question, this is the best thing I have ever tasted. I am in love with the Häagen-Dazs vanilla blackberry flavor. Please, Häagen-Dazs, don’t ever stop making this. Just rich, creamy yumminess...it’s a party in your mouth!"
62_hd,1,1.0,0.0,This used to be my favorite haagen dazs ice cream till they added the extra chocolate. Now the chocolate is overpowering and I cant taste the other delicious flavors very well
62_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"I have been waiting to find rhe trio line in our stores for months. I finally found one flavor, spent over five dollars and found it taste like sour icemilk."
62_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"My husband loves it, I, myself, would prefer vanilla and blackberry together, minus the chocolate."
62_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor combination is out of this world. Highly recommend!
62_hd,1,1.0,0.0,Tastes like rotten milk. I almost puked. I still might.
63_hd,5,8.0,1.0,This is hands down the most delicious ice cream Ive ever tasted! The rich yet subtle ice cream flavors (vanilla & caramel) pair perfectly with the crisp thin white chocolate resulting in the perfect sophisticated and irresistibly sweet combination.
63_hd,5,4.0,0.0,Absolutely delicious creamy and smooth. Taste was rich and luscious. The vanilla was just the prefect balance of sweetness and creamy the salted Carmel layer was surprisingly smooth and chewy and tasted like a real classy Carmel. The crispy layer added a nice crunch. To the mix. Overall a decadently delicious mix that is a great big winner!!
63_hd,5,4.0,1.0,Wow. I love this flavor so much! I was walking in Kroger shopping for my mom and I saw the picture but didnt think to get it. I called her later on before she got home and asked her to stop by and get me some cause it couldnt leave my mind. I am SO GLAD I did! It is so good! Ive only had it once because every store I go to is out of stock :/ Ive been craving it for a week and check the stores every day. One of these days Ill find it!
63_hd,5,3.0,0.0,I’m usually a chocolate kind of gal (milk & dark). I actually bought this ice cream for my husband because he loves white chocolate and caramel. I decided to taste it and I have literally been obsessed since. I once went to twelve different grocery stores in one day to try to find one that wasn’t completely out of it. Obsession is an understatement.
63_hd,5,4.0,0.0,Hands down the best flavor of any ice cream. White chocolate is so hard to find in ice creams and this combination is to die for!! Wish I could eat this everyday.
63_hd,5,3.0,0.0,This combo is spectacular! I truly enjoyed the flavors of the vanilla and caramel ice cream. Then I get to the fun part which is the caramel sauce and white chocolate chips. This reminds of a less sweeter version of dulce de leche. I like that because the dulce is extremely sweet for my taste buds.
63_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"This ice cream is simply amazing! The salty caramel and crunchy white chocolate layers really make this ice cream. I couldn’t stop scooping more bites. Needless to say, I’m addicted!"

63_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I love white chocolate and vanilla-based ice cream, so I had to try it. It certainly didnt disappoint. Honestly, its the only ice cream I ever buy now. I love the crunchy ribbons of white chocolate throughout. Its the perfect amount of caramel, which often makes other ice creams much too sweet."
63_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I tasted this flavor and I fell in love !!! The only problem is you cant find these flavor at all of the stores!!! Haagen Dazs please make sure you stock this flavor at all of the stores Thanks!!!
63_hd,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream. I love white chocolate and that mixed with caramel is AMAZING!! The only problem is it’s kinda hard for me to find in stores and I wish they had a bigger size.
63_hd,5,1.0,0.0,This is by far my most favorite ice cream in the world. Thank you Häagen-Dazs for making my new favorite ice cream...
64_hd,5,17.0,2.0,This is my favourite flavor and Hageen Dad does it best. Creamy vanilla ice cream with the perfect amount of rich circulate pieces in it. My only complaint is that it seems to have become unavailable again in all my local stores. they had discontinued it once before a few years ago and I think it is happening again. Bring it back!!
64_hd,5,7.0,2.0,I have been eating Haagen Daz since 1975. It is by far the highest quality ice cream you can find anywhere. I am always trying ice cream when I travel and cannot find any as flavorful or as creamy as this. My personal favorite is Vanilla Chocolate Chip and I am proud to say that have passed this on to my nieces and nephew! Many wonderful memories created over enjoying this wonderful delicacy. Please dont even think about discontinuing this flavor again! It is getting difficult to find in our area again!
64_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"First time trying this flavor. Maybe its an off day or something but this Haagen-Dazs doesnt taste like the usual high quality ice creams that they are known for. The vanilla ice cream didnt really taste like vanilla so much as sugar and milk. The texture was more icy than creamy and honestly tasted cheap, which isnt what I was hoping for in a $7 pint. Maybe its the ""lactose reduced"" skim milk on the ingredients list? Im not sure why they would use a lactose reduced milk or if that has anything to do with texture quality but this flavor is a definite miss."

I went to 5 grocery stores just looking to buy this flavor! The stores I was told from your website do not have this flavor in stock either! ( it says it does) Help!"
64_hd,5,6.0,2.0,I love this ice cream - it’s the only flavor I buy. It’s simple and it always hits the spot. BUT I’m having the hardest time finding it!! There’s tons of other crazy HD flavors but not the classic. What’s going on?
64_hd,5,2.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream flavor since my childhood. Very hard to find on the west coast. Every store should be carrying this Vanilla Chocolate Chip Ice Cream!
64_hd,5,3.0,2.0,"I love, love, love this flavor. When it wasnt being produced anymore I thought I would pass out. Now that it is back it is like finding a needle in a hay stack. Hopefully some stores in my area will get on the band wagon and carry it. So creamy with the right amount of chocolate chips. Wish I was eating some now."

64_hd,5,1.0,0.0,I first fell in L O V E with this flavor in Miami Beach. I came back to my home in NC and looked everywhere for this flavor. Recently I took another trip to Florida (Orlando) and found the flavor there! Why is it so hard to find in NC???!
64_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Nothing compares with the creamy deliciousness of vanilla paired with satisfying dark chocolate pieces. This is difficult to find in my area and we do go out of our way to obtain it (often in the dark of night)

64_hd,5,1.0,0.0,Vanilla Chip and Vanilla Swiss Almond compete for the title of best ice cream in the world.
64_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"WHERE IS THE VANILLA CHOCOLATE CHIP? Dont tell ME its the ""store buyers"". All three (3) different chains at exactly the same time? When these had Vanilla CC it ALWAYS rarely sat more than 3-4 days from shelf space of 2 rows 2x stacked. This is by Direct Observation man. VCC disappeared, given remaining stock level/s, near exactly at the beginning of June. Since then, even the SKU tags that were attached to the shelf positions have been removed. And by the way, the Choc Choc-Chip moves as poorly as those new flavors - like molasses up a hill. And I gotta ask - what genius came up with ""Green Tee"" ice cream? Like Choc Choc-Chip and several of the new flavors they cant GIVE it away around here."
65_hd,4,4.0,0.0,"Dessert is my favorite meal of the day and at age 42, I feel like I’ve sampled quite a variety of dessert options! Even with many other options available, I often want to treat myself to Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars! The milk chocolate shell is my favorite part - it’s thick, rich, and it never cracks or falls apart like less expensive ice cream bars do. The chocolate is so good, it’s like having a gourmet candy bar wrapped around my ice cream! The vanilla ice cream is not as rich as I’d like but it is definitely tasty and creamy. My primary complaint about these bars is that there are only 3 in a package and they are quite expensive."
65_hd,5,4.0,0.0,"I received the Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Milk Chocolate bars free for reviewing purposes and they were delicious. I loved the hard texture of the chocolate on the outside mixed with the creamy ice cream, it was definitely a treat I will get again. I think 3 in a box is a safe bet because otherwise I will eat too many."
65_hd,4,1.0,0.0,I received a coupon to try a complimentary Haagen-dazs product for testing purposes. All opinions are my own. I selected the Vanilla Milk Chocolate Bars. These come three to a box and are ice cream on a wooden stick. The milk chocolate that coats the outside is thick and very tasty. It is my favorite part. The vanilla ice cream on the inside is a generous portion and creamy. These bars are very thick and make for a satisfying sweet treat. I wish there was more than three to a box but considering the size of the bars they are worth the price point.
65_hd,5,1.0,0.0,"I mean, its ice cream, what can I say. But then again, its not JUST ice cream. Haagen-dazs does some kind of voodoo on their products. Lol just kidding..but maybe. They are just addictingly good, the chocolate was smooth and creamy. The ice cream was smooth and creamy. How do they make it so good??!!! I actually hid the box of these bars because I didnt want to share ha! Yes people they are that good. You wont want to share either."
66_hd,1,7.0,1.0,"I bought a box of the this a week ago and there was no issue with the overall taste. Then just a few days ago I bought another box this time around the box was different (I guess it was the birthday addition because that’s what was stated on the box. Anyway the taste of the ice cream was horrible it just tasted like frozen milk, nothing at all like the one I had from the first box, and the outer part was not only thinner but tasted cheap almost like a generic nestle bar which is disgusting and there was way less almonds. I was very disappointed because the cost wasn’t cheap at my local super market. Don’t think I’ll be purchasing again if this is the new taste of them :("
66_hd,1,33.0,3.0,"I grew up eating Haagen Daz and it was always a treat for me. I havent had it in a couple of years because Im lactose intolerant and lactase pills dont work, but I was really craving that creamy, rich vanilla and think chocolate and crunchy almonds that I remember from my childhood in the 90s. But I regret wasting my money on something that tasted cheap as if it were a knock off of the brand. The bar is now 50% smaller, the chocolate is not thick and rich, the vanilla was icy, watery and did not taste like vanilla. Im very disappointed with this product and will not waste money on haagen daz anymore."
66_hd,2,41.0,2.0,"Got a big box from costco and from one week to the next, they had completely changed! Its not just the shape, which is a smaller rectangle compared to I guess the more triangular shape it used to be? The chocolate coating is thinner - I take one bite and the entire side of coating falls off into my lap- and overall the flavor doesnt taste as rich or as good of quality anymore. Both the chocolate and the ice cream are just kind of bland. I probably wouldve thought it was all in my head except having a back-to-back comparison between boxes. Wont be buying these anymore, such a shame."
66_hd,2,66.0,9.0,I am diabetic and cannot enjoy your product very often. Today the temp was 120 F and I had to have some Ice Cream and this product was one of my favorites. The size is much smaller. the creamy taste was gone. the milk chocolate coating was not the rich snappy coating of old. When I indulge I want the best. I will pay for the best. You did yourself no favors by lessening the product. When you change something to save money you lose the customer that made your product so great. I will search for another company that makes a truly indulgent Ice cream bar for when I must have one. It will not be yours. That is the choice I make when you make yours to save a few cents in production costs.
66_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"Ive been eating Haagen Dazs for more than 40 years. I rarely eat any other ice cream; my favorite is the milk chocolate with vanilla ice cream bar. I know for sure that the size of the bars is about half the size they were a few years ago. I joke with my husband about how, if the size continues to decrease, Ill be taking Haagan Daz pills in a couple of years. Its not really funny because, at the same time, the price has doubled and the ice cream does taste more like ice milk, at times. The jars dont seem to have changed much. What happened to the bars? We know something changed, the size, for sure, so dont gaslight us, please."
66_hd,2,41.0,4.0,"We always buy them from Costco, especially when they are $3 off. But last week the bars are smaller, and most of the almonds disappeared! OMG, it looks nothing like before, or the picture still show on the box! It also tastes different, the chocolate taste somehow is the same. The skimming of the almonds is not something Id take. After all, at least to me, the Haagen-Dazs stood out from all other brands as the generous amount of almonds. I took the box back to Costco for a refund. Got another box, hoping that it was just my bad luck on the last box. But no, still the same. I couldnt believe you guys are loosing so much quality on this well loved treat. Please change it back!!!"
66_hd,1,18.0,3.0,"When you purchase Haagen Daas or Ben and Jerry’s or Talenti, you expect a Superior product because of the price point and also the reputation. My husband and I have purchased these bars for years from Costco and sadly, we will not be purchasing these anymore. As two people with lactose intolerance, ice cream has to be amazing for us to suffer through the side effects that follow. The new bars have hardly any almonds (the one I just ate had three almond pieces on each side) and the chocolate coating is thin and brittle. Please fix this product because we genuinely enjoyed eating these. The margins that were cut from an expense perspective are not worth it to your clientele."
66_hd,2,9.0,0.0,"Wow, you used to be the only ice cream for me. Ice cream =Haagen Dazs, all others just frauds. Now I bite into a smaller bar, coated in a chocolate glaze more akin to confectioners sugar and water and not at all like the thick, artisanally tempered,snappy goodness I had come to expect. I could live with the sparser coating, but the ice cream inside is more ice , less cream! Is it the skim milk? Haagen Daz used to be so rich I could only eat a few spoons of a pint or just one bar and be content with that for the week. Now it tastes like everything else. No more luxury to justify the higher price."
66_hd,2,22.0,3.0,I buy these all the time at costco but recently its been hit or miss. Half the time the bars are excellent and the vanilla ice cream is rich/creamy. The other half the ice cream tastes bland and has no taste.(think frozen watered down milk). Ive had to return 3 boxes so far but have been able to find a good batch here and there. I like them but dont feel like going back to return them half the time. I write this as I pack up another box to return. When its good its great but when its not its like eating frozen and grainy watered down milk.
66_hd,2,27.0,2.0,"I used to love my Häagen-Dazs bars. They were absolutely my favorite ice cream. I recently purchased my usual box and was incredibly disappointed to find that the bars were significantly smaller, the chocolate coating was thinner, and the vanilla ice cream inside wasnt as creamy."
66_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"As I was looking on the web about the past size and the quality of these bars, I bumped into this website. I couldnt agree more with all the post that the quality of this product has gone down the drain. As I still have the empty ice cream stick in my mouth, while I am writing this review, who knows this could be the last time I am buying your product. What really bothered me the most is the size more than the taste, not to mention which is not as good as it used to be. I might look for another better brand, which I can think of few that I liked before. Either way the taste is more important to my family than the size. Very disappointed with over all many products that Costco sells including this one."
66_hd,1,12.0,0.0,"these used to be the best bars. Now, the coating is paper-thin and tasteless, and the vanilla (whatever it is) is gross. Dont bother about sending an email to ""find out the problem,"" nor do I want coupons--you couldnt pay me to eat another one. You already know what the problem is: You changed it to save money. Everyone noticed, and no amount of PR will salvage your stupid decision."
66_hd,2,12.0,1.0,"For me, Haagan Daaz was the image of indulgence after a long day. But everything changed, since they changed their recipe. At first glance, the bar was noticeably smaller, to which I figured theyre cutting costs, oh well. But first bite, the outer chocolate covering is thinner! I cant tell if it even is as rich. And the vanilla ice cream itself was okay. I finished eating it, it was just okay. Nothing special. Unfulfilling. What happened??"
66_hd,2,8.0,1.0,"I bought two boxes at Costco last week but am very disappointed in the decline in quality. Our family has loved the creamy and flavorful taste of these bars for some time.. However, this last batch tastes more like ice milk and the bars seem smaller than in the past. I logged onto your website and was amazed that many other reviews expressed the same disappointment. What happened to your recipe???? Needless to say, I wish I had not purchased two boxes and dont plan to purchase any others in the future."
66_hd,2,5.0,0.0,"Recently bought a 15 pack from Costco that came with only 14 bars. Additionally, we weighed each bar (with the wrapper one), and each one only weighed 2.6oz-2.8oz, which is not the reported 3oz thats written on the box. Writing this because other people have noticed a smaller sized bar recently, and this case study proves they are correct. The flavor of the actual vanilla ice cream has also become less creamy and more firm; almost seems like a change in recipe has occurred."
66_hd,2,5.0,0.0,"I used to love these bars, my go to when I had a stressful day, because they were hard ice cream, Belgium chocolate and lots of almonds...I introduced all of my 11 children to the wonders of this bar...Now the ice cream is so whipped it can get ruined even in your subzero freezer, the chocolate is over sweet, Belgium chocolate is NOT over sweet, thats why it so good, Im just so disappointed after decades of eating it I will have to find a new love, or make my own."
66_hd,1,3.0,0.0,"Just purchased the big box from Costco last week and they are not the same product. Would like to believe its the batch however, from all the reviews/comments its not limited to the batch but is a change in formula/recipe. Best description of the ice cream is a flavorless, frozen, watered down milk. Chocolate is also not very flavorful. Tastes artificial and texture is chalky - why would Haagen Daz risk reputation & market share to save a few pennies? Will not be purchasing again - will be returning the product to Costco."
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"These ice cream bars are not the same as they used to be. In fact, nowhere near what they used to be. If Haagen-Dazs first came out with this current version years and years ago, they never would have gotten off to a good start and would not ha e been popular. I will never buy these again. Theyre too small, too thin now, and not nearly as indulgent as they used to be. The ice cream didnt even seem as thick and creamy as it used to be. Did another company by them out? There ice cream bars are now just generic ice cream bars. Im going for Dove bars from now on."
66_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"Hello! I have always enjoyed the high quality of Haagen Dazs Ice Cream and Ice Cream Bars. The ice cream has always been so incredibly creamy and delicious. So, when I bought a box of the Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almond Ice Cream Bars, I expected that same high quality. But when I took a bite of the ice cream bar, I immediately noticed a difference. The ice cream tasted like ice milk. As I looked at the ingredients, I noticed soy was listed. I dont believe this ingredient was in the original list. Because soy tends to change the chemistry of a recipe when mixed with cream, this might be the reason for the change in the taste.I sincerely hope you consider going back to the original recipe."
66_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"Bought a box of Costco and they are so different from the ones I had last year (and we went through 3-4 boxes last summer!) Instead of being creamy and thick, the ice cream was icy and thin. Not like the Haagen-Dazs I know :( The chocolate part was still really crunchy and remains my favorite part of the bar. Like other reviewers said, it has gotten smaller as well :( I dont think I could justify eating 290 calories of a bar thats smaller and less tasty than the older versions of this almond bar. They might have also gotten a little sweeter, or maybe thats my imagination playing with me. My boyfriend tried them for the first time after I told them how tasty they were from my memory and he didnt think they were that great. In fact, he prefers the similar Kirkland chocolate almond ice cream bars to this product."
66_hd,3,11.0,1.0,Usually get a box of 15 bars this flavor from Costco but this last box is a little off. Some of the ice cream is icy rather than creamy and the chocolate coating was shedding as you eat. This is happening more than normal and I wonder if the recipe or the processing had changed .
66_hd,3,3.0,0.0,"Used to be better, barely freeze at 10 degrees, and I have checked the temperature with a professional digital thermometer. Everything else in my freezer is rock hard, but when you bite into a chocolate covered vanilla bar, it collapses and makes a mess. Some kind of ingredient was added in the past two or three years to make the ice cream creamy. Dove and Kirkland bars are rock solid. NOTE HOW TWO OF THE SURVEY QUESTIONS ASK ABOUT INCREASING CREAMY TEXTURE BUT NOT ABOUT DOING THE OPPOSITE. Too bad!"
66_hd,3,5.0,0.0,I dont understand how did these amazing creamy crunchy ice creams get so bad. I opened up an almond ice cream and omg I never seen one so small! We as customers are loyal to you and this is how u repay us by downsizing and not caring how your product is despenced. In other words not kept at the correct temperatures then when we purchase them it is completely different in taste.
66_hd,2,10.0,2.0,"Purchased the usual box at Costco and thought it was just my imagination that the bars were smaller, slightly different shaped. Was even more disappointed after taking a bite and noted the ice cream wasn’t as rich and creamy as the last box I purchased. Texture seemed icy and not as high quality from just a few months ago. What happened?? Please go back to the original recipe!!!"
66_hd,2,5.0,0.0,Our family has been buying these bars for years now but recently I’ve noticed the bars getting smaller and the price has not changed. Not only that but i feel like the ice cream quality has gone down too. I’ve always thought of Haagen dazs as high quality ice cream so needless to say i was very disappointed.
66_hd,1,10.0,1.0,Chocolate shell was very thin and fell off after a couple of bites. Ice cream was bland and not smooth and creamy. My taste buds were very disappointed.
66_hd,3,6.0,0.0,"They are just ok... I remeber you guys having the best vanilla ice cream out there... but these bars are not as creamy and tasty as they used to. Not bad, not extraordinary either."
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"It tastes like a knock-off, like soft-serve. Haagen Daz is not SOFT SERVE! The ice cream is not dense, I used to enjoy the thick dense haagen daz vanilla ice cream with almonds bar, it took many licks to get it down. Now its like soft serve. I dont know why they changed the best ice cream bar in the world. I feel bad for todays kids. I need to find another brand that can provide the dense haggen daz ice cream of the past. Thanks for the memories, wish you guys would bring back the original recipe from years ago."
66_hd,1,5.0,0.0,"Sadly, these bars have seriously lost their good quality taste. I use to love these bars! The bars are much smaller, ice cream is not as smooth and it those delicious chunks of almonds are basically gone. I’m disappointed, hopefully they’ll bring back what is missed."
66_hd,1,9.0,1.0,"Yes, these bars have definitely gone down hill in quality, just as Nestle did with Turtles. Bland taste, change in texture - a regular purchase no longer worth buying."
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,The vanilla ice cream tasted watery and had a gritty texture similar to low quality ice milk products. In the past the bars that I purchased tasted top quality with a delicious dense but rich creamy flavorful taste and texture. I will not be buying the Haagen-dazs ice cream bars again as it is a waste of my money. I just hope that the pint of strawberry ice cream that I bought at the same time still has the great high quality taste and texture it had the previous time I bought some about 2 months ago.
66_hd,2,3.0,0.0,"I agree with other reviewers that this is not the same quality Haagen dazs bars we’ve been used to in the past. We also bought from Costco - (not sure if that makes a difference... I sometimes wonder if companies make different/cheaper formulations for big box companies). The ice cream is definitely not Haagen dazs quality - not nearly as creamy or rich, feels more like ice milk. Chocolate seems “meh”. We are very disappointed."
66_hd,2,4.0,0.0,"Wow, thought i was loosing it. until i read other reviews. These were always a special treat for me and guests. Last ones i bought were smaller and didnt seem as rich tasting. I was going to buy more and hoping they were bigger as i couldnt remember from last box i bought. Sure hope the large ones return for my next purchase."
66_hd,1,4.0,0.0,I cant believe we all are disapointed with the same flavor and purchasing them from Costco.My son noticed the subpar ice cream right away.It was like ice milk my mom use to eat when she dieted.Not cream at all I feel like I wasted good money on bad ice cream 15 bars of a bad thing isnt good at all.
66_hd,3,4.0,0.0,Love the chocolate/chocolate! Tried the vanilla w nuts at Costco. Not sure why the Costco ones seem to be different quality. The milk chocolate cover isn’t as I remember. Did you change the recipe?

66_hd,3,4.0,1.0,"I love(d) the bars - especially the coffee milk chocolate bars. However - the texture seems to have changed from the advertised creamy to the actual flavorless frozen milk experience. Ill continue to buy them, but Im very disappointed. Im sorry to say this but Ben & Jerrys wins in the creaminess department,"
66_hd,1,3.0,1.0,"I know that minumum wage is raising but that doesnt mean that the sizes should decrease, your change made it taste worse and look like a childrens popsicle that comes with stickers. Honestly im going to stop buying your products and buy dryers for now unless you guys can prove to me that ur products are worth the price. Atleast dryers can prove to me that qulity over quality is better."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"For years, Haagen Daz had THE best ice cream and the VSA bars were everything, with the thick Belgian chocolate coating full of roasted almond pieces encasing the best vanilla ice cream available. I guess everything must come to an end. Its a real shame. And the fact that consumers are still being charged premium prices for subpar product ads insult to injury. In fact, I would much prefer a run of the mill version over what has become of the HD brand. The chocolate coating is awful, the nuts less plentiful and all the rich specialness of the vanilla ice cream is gone. Blue Bunny is MUCH better. I dont know if HD is farming production out to new Mars or if they just wholesale changed the recipe but until I hear from consumers that they have returned to their origin as l taste and quality, I am DONE."
66_hd,2,4.0,1.0,"We eat these as a treat after dinner every evening. For the past month, we have purchased the bars at 2 different stores and the ice cream is not creamy. We are hopeful you get the original recipe back or this was a bad batch. So disappointing."
66_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Weve been buying these bars for years from Costco and we love them. Chocolate coating is thick and creamy, as is the ice cream inside. Ive never seen any change in quality.

66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,Recently bought a box from Costco and the flavor is not as smooth and creamy as before. The bars are also significantly smaller and have less almonds.

66_hd,2,2.0,0.0,"Every time I buy this ice cream am satisfied but since last 3 times the quality and size seems to be going down, not the same creamy texture and size seems way too small for the kids to enjoy, i hope you keep the quality and increase the price rather than going substandard at Costco stores"

Not sure why so many negative reviews but I have loved these bars for the past 8 years so, please no changes. Chocolate is great and ice cream is great and thick. I can tell there was great time and quality put in to each bar... they don’t melt as soon as I step outside like other brands! Keep up the great work!!"
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"What happened to this summer favorite? I got two boxes from the Costco this month and they dont taste like Haagen Dazs anymore. Did your guys changed the formula or something? Is so, its really a shame. Your guys need to stand up to the Nestle instead being another corporate sellout."
66_hd,3,1.0,0.0,I always purchase these bars every once in a while and I love them so much! They are probably my favorite ice cream bars! it seems that every time I get them they are smaller and smaller every time. I recently purchased a box a few days ago and the ice cream in the bars had a very gritty texture that makes the ice cream taste kind of funky and Ive never experienced that with these bars before. I really hope the next time I purchase they will be back to normal.
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,I recently purchased a box of vanilla chocolate almond ice cream bars at Costco and to my dismay I was appalled at how small they were with half the almonds. What was management thinking. Going forward I will find mother ice cream bar to eat. What a shame!
66_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"This has been a great product over the years but the last Costco box is obviously a vastly different bar, it even has a different shape. It appears and tastes like the ""ice cream"" has been cheapened to ice milk. The rich taste is gone! Too bad!"

Were shocked to find out that the size shrunk and poor taste... the vanilla ice cream wasnt creamy, it was like icy milk water, very odd texture... its not ice cream without cream! Very disappointed!

The chocolate exterior is still delicious but the ice cream interior is for lack of a better term gritty. It’s bumpy and almost sandy. Not smooth and creamy like it used to be. I thought I got a bad box and purchased two more boxes on different occasions. Each time I’ve had the same issue. Very disappointing and sad.

66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite Ice Cream bar. Just had one, and as other reviewers have mentioned the size is much smaller. That is nothing new, every brand is making their products smaller in size. Unfortunately, the great taste has managed to disappear as well. The vanilla ice cream tasted icy and bland. Rather than a nice creamy vanilla, it almost crumbles. Very disappointed."
66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"These bars used to be my favourite! Now, it seems that everything, save the popsicle stick, has gone down in terms of quality. The chocolate is nothing like it used to be, missing the rich chocolate-y taste and texture that it used to be. The same holds true for the ice cream inside- its always lacking the creaminess that once made it iconic. I am quite unsatisfied."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"This company can deny all they want that they haven’t changed their recipe but come on do you think your consumers are stupid? Thinner coating of chocolate, significantly less almond bits, icy watered down filling. What a disappointment!

66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"I wasnt sure if it was just me or if I just had a bad batch, but after looking at the other reviews, I do not seem to be the only one who has noticed a change in the product. Haagen-Dazs bars have always been a bit of a special treat. If I am going to use my calories on ice cream, I would rather splurge on something decadent than eat something of lower quality. In the past Haagen-Dazs bars were rich and creamy, with a nice thick chocolate coating. The bars are now smaller, the chocolate coating is thin and the ice cream is not as creamy."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"The taste of the vanilla ice cream in these bars is awful now. The ice cream tasted very grainy and watery, not rich and creamy how it used to. Did something change?

66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I used to love Haagen Daz ice cream and bars but not anymore. They are now half the size and half the flavor. You can definitely tell that they are using cheap ingredients.

66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"So i have bought the Kirkland bars and these, they are surprisingly small, and there were 15. The ice cream from Kirkland was bigger, and there were 18 bars in those. So I think this was a waste of money"
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I havent had these in a long time and I was looking forward to a decadent dessert. Boy was I disappointed it tasted like ice milk with ice crystals in it. Is this a new formula?
66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"not as good as before--size has decreased immensely. flavor is not so great either, wish they could go back to what they were a couple months ago (pretty sure something changed)"
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,Was craving something sweet. My husband bought a 3 pack of bars. Opened it up and about fell over. It was so tiny. Same price less product. Not cool.
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream bars have less chocolate fewer nuts & are smaller. Does the size vary if purchased at different locations? Totally disappointed.
66_hd,4,1.0,0.0,My wife just bought a box from Costco and we noticed the ice cream bars are smaller than usual I wish they kept the original size
66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,"Was expecting much more from a premium ice cream bar. The chocolate has a very strange artificial, almost chemical taste to it."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"This has a very ice milk taste, not creamy like the low budget brands. Might as well buy the cheaper low budget brands."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"There is something different about the size, coating, and shape of the bars. It is not the same - lessor quality."
66_hd,2,1.0,0.0,Bars have shrunk. Far better to just raise your prices! Shrinking them is just slimy.
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,They are much smaller then they used to be. For the price charged it’s ridiculous!
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,"If Haagen Dazs pays attention to reviews and notices that so many reviews are saying that the product is just not as good as it used to be then how is it that they continue to respond with not admitting they changed the product? Consumers are not stupid? It is not the same! Ice cream is not as rich and creamy (more air is pumped in it), chocolate coating is not as good (taste like chocolate coating used on cheaper bars vs rich milk chocolate) and it is smaller. Also it does not satisfy. What I mean about not satisfying, is that a rich high quality ice cream bar will melt slowly in your mouth from each bite (from its creamy richness) and as you get close to finishing the bar you begin to feel satisfied from your indulgence and not wanting more. Haagen Dazs used to satisfy....now it does not. Shame! As I rate this product at one star, I am referring and comparing it to how it used to be and not so much as the product on its own today, since if one was to eat a Haagen Dazs bar for the very first time today it would stand up fine to many standard bars on the market. The issue is just that a Haagen Dazs bar is a premium bar with a premium price and that deserves a premium rich quality product....just like it used to be."
66_hd,1,1.0,0.0,I thought these were as years ago. Forget it. i will trash them
67_hd,5,7.0,0.0,"They definitely need to make these in a bigger size. Its so delicious! Its creamy and rich. The chocolate with almonds is a perfect combination too. It has a good amount of almonds too. When you have chocolate, almonds and vanilla together, you know it has to be good. Simply delicious!"
67_hd,4,2.0,0.0,I tried the Haagen-Dazs vanilla milk chocolate almond...snack size bars and it was actually really good. Snack size...is small and cute! Lol. It definitely hit the spot for SNACK! And it packed a. Whole lot of flavor in the little bars. I didnt want to share these with anyone....almost made me feel like i had a super expensive ....once a year type snack. If you want a small snack and icecream with chocolate to boot....these are perfect.....definitely worth splurging on for yourself!
67_hd,1,8.0,1.0,"This was my favorite ice cream. Key word: was. Unfortunately the recipe has obviously been changed, and lower quality ingredients are being used. Also - corn syrup! The ice cream almost looked like plastic when I first opened the container instead of the delicious creamy goodness that it used to be. It was also way sweeter than it used to be and didnt taste like vanilla - it tasted like marshmallow. Wont be buying this anymore and am off to find a new premium brand that makes ice creams in a traditional way and without gross unnecessary ingredients."
67_hd,2,3.0,1.0,"The last 2 containers of vanilla Swiss almond then Ive had, barely had any chocolate covered almonds! Feels like such a waste to spend as much money on a small container of ice cream and be disappointed. I thought it was just me, but it seems the flavor has changed. It also melts quickly and doesnt seem as thick and dense as it used to. I second the previous posters comment that the plus side is that I wont be eating this anymore and saving myself the calories. Its ashame, Ive been buying this flavor for over 15 years. 2 stars because thats how Id rate something disappointing but edible like breyers."

67_hd,3,1.0,0.0,I just bought my wife a pint of swiss almond and opened up the ice cream and it was vanilla ice cream only no almonds at all we love this ice cream and are extremely disappointed with the out come of our sweet treat tonight
67_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"Häagen-Dazs makes the best ice cream in the world in my opinion. Every flavor I try becomes my immediate new favorite and Im instantly hooked. I eat ice cream almost daily, every evening and Häagen-Dazs is what I like to eat. Ive tried almost all of there flavors but my new personnel favorite is the Vanilla Swiss Almond. It is simply delicious. Silky smooth ice cram with tasty Almonds combines for a treat that I can not get enough of. I feel like a kid who wants ice cream for every meal."
67_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I dont often treat myself to ice cream but when I do I tend to gravitate towards the more decadent brands like Haagen-dazs. I love the creamy, natural vanilla flavor of their Vanilla Swiss Almond and the almonds dipped in rich chocolate were the bomb. I usually go for ice cream that contains nuts, fruits or chips and this one is definitely my new favorite. The only drawback I have found is that this flavor tends to be a little more difficult to find but well worth the effort for sure."
67_hd,1,2.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite ice cream for years, but it hadn’t been in stock recently at my grocery store. When I saw it today, I noticed the picture had changed, but I snatched it up, and the first bite instantly told me they had also changed the formula. The chocolate flavor is off and there is now a distinct chemical aftertaste. What a disappointment! Haagen-Dazs, please bring back the original formulation of this once-superb ice cream!"
67_hd,1,2.0,0.0,please stop using corn syrup in your recipe as it messes up the taste of the icecream. im really disappointed with the taste of it lately and the last few cartons barely had any almonds. oo
67_hd,4,1.0,0.0,"We used to have this flavour in the UK years ago, it’s my all time favourite. Now I have to wait until I come to the States to satisfy my craving. Unless you can invent a way to ship to me I think you should comeback soon. It’s the subtlety that makes it so good."

And the hazelnut fudge - delicious! I bought a pint in the morning and ate the entire thing almost in one sitting. Went back to the store in the afternoon and got the last tub. Will be restocking on this one for sure!"
68_hd,3,1.0,0.0,"I do not drink, so have never had whiskey. I wanted to try this mainly because of the coffee ice cream, hazelnut & espresso flakes, which are flavor profiles that I like. But I can hardly taste the coffee, as the whiskey seems to be the only thing that is coming through. The hazelnut is not very prominent either, I have to eat the fudge by itself in order to taste what little hazelnut flavor is in there. What probably masked the flavor of the hazelnut was because of the chocolate espresso flakes. Thats all I was tasting, which I like, but I think there was too much of it and not enough of the hazelnut. If the hazelnut & coffee flavor are more pronounced, this would be a good ice cream."
68_hd,5,5.0,0.0,"...an ice cream that will change your life. I bought this and the Amaretto last night...theyre both half gone. The flavor profile is absolutely phenomenal and even has the after aroma on your pallet as you would have sipping a nice whiskey itself. Could not recommend enough. Häagen-Daz, you hit a homerun!!"
68_hd,5,6.0,0.0,"This flavor is amazing, I was completely blown away when I first tasted it. It is my new favorite for sure. PLEASE never stop making this, if you do I will cry. Thanks in advance."

68_hd,5,2.0,0.0,"I am so addicted to the unexpected married flavors of Whiskey Hazelnut Latte Ice Cream. This flavor is beyond delicious and I am always sad when I scrap the end of the pint. I really wish I could buy a bigger size. I really enjoy ice cream and I was searching for something different and I found it in this flavor. I didnt want to write a review for fear there would be shortage. However, what shame to not spread the word on such a wonderful treat."
69_hd,5,2.0,0.0,My heart broke when the Peanut Butter ice cream bar was discontinued. Then this one came out< and I am once again in heaven. The raspberry flavor is the best. Haagen Dazs you are the greatest ice cream on earth. Keep these creations coming!

69_hd,1,4.0,2.0,I love haagen dazs but the chocolate on these crumbles off and the ice cream is lacking the usual high quality taste of haagen dazs ice cream.

0_talenti,5,12.0,0.0,"Y’all! I’m sick as a dog!!! For reals! Temp of over 101. Begged my mom to get me some talenti because it’s my new favorite again. Anyways I told her to get something non-dairy for my throat so it wouldn’t get all yucky. She brings me this flavor. O.M.G. THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!! Ok, I have a cold so everything tastes bland so this shouldn’t be all that great right? No. This tastes like the actual mango, but like better than the actual mango!!! Seriously! Every flavor I try is my new favorite!! I 100% recommend this and all the other flavors! Talenti is the best. Oh! And there’s always a treat at the end. You can reuse the container. These guys are the best!!"
0_talenti,5,21.0,0.0,"This is seriously like eating fresh mangoes smashed up and put into a container. Many other surveys on the market remind me to much of ice cream and have a creaminess to them. Some people enjoy this, however I prefer a sorbet to taste just like fresh fruit. The ingredients in this could not be more direct. Mangoes, sugar, water, dextrose And lemon juice. At first I did not think I would like the tartness from the lemon juice. However it gives just a bit of lemon flavor, Which almost accentuates the mangoes. This is by far our favorite!"
0_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,"When I first tried this sorbetto (the first thing I ever tried from Talenti), I wasnt expecting much. I was thinking it would probably taste like the other mango sorbets that I had tried, enough flavor to know that it was mango but not much else. Then, I had my first spoonful. To me, it tasted as though someone had pureed and frozen a mango and put it in the container. It was delicious. The flavor was so intense. Ive convinced several other family members to try it since then, and theyve agreed with me. Weve all become Talenti converts thanks to this mango sorbetto."
0_talenti,5,18.0,0.0,"Really taste like youre eating a chilled mango. It is one of my new favorite flavors. It is on the sweeter side though. Would love to see it with less sugar, so you can really taste the mango more. Otherwise its amazing!"

Tried to find it and it was costing $40 per piece. Yes, they are actually that precious. These mangoes are royal gift from India’s president to all head of states and loved by them. We keep security guards for those precious trees. This shorbotto is offers just 10% taste of actual taste of authentic Alphonso. Still happy to have at least bit of flavor to kill homesickness. Love Alphanso !"

I do not have a sweet tooth.. but sometimes I just need a little something and this is it!!"
0_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"No joke. Its like Talenti found the most delicious bite out of 10 mangos and stuffed it all in a frozen cup of golden sunshine. It tastes like a vacation. My wife is 7 months pregnant with our son, and is scouring every market and grocer within 50 miles for the sweet respite of Alphonso Mango. Alas, the shelves do not comply and I am left in fear as my beloved remains unsatiated and spiteful. Where can I go? Please? Pity me. She and the unborn bun will not rest until I find the source of splendor that is Alphonso Mango. Thank you for reaching out, we are sorry to hear you are having difficulty finding this product.

0_talenti,2,4.0,2.0,"Having grown up eating tons fresh alphonso magoes in India, I can definitely say that the taste seems quite off from the real stuff. This tastes more like canned mango pulp which is sold in several stores. Real alphonso mangoes have perfect balance of sweet and tart and need nothing to enhance the taste. This had way too much sugar and very over sweet. The fact that they add lemon and sugar just does not sound right. I was expecting much more!"
0_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"My son is allergic to milk and weve had a hard time finding desserts that he can enjoy. Tonight we bought the mango and raspberry gelato and hands down this is the best!

0_talenti,3,4.0,2.0,"Ive eaten mangos from all over the carribean, US and Mexico. This has the essence of mango flavor, but the added sugar and too much carob gum really detracts from mango flavor. I really wish they had reduced the sugar, increased the tartness with more lemon or tart passion fruit or something. This was a big miss for me, but Roman Raspberry is Awesome."
0_talenti,5,5.0,2.0,"The most amazing sorbet Ive ever had! I have been vegan for quite a while now and even before I was vegan, I could never find an ice cream or sorbet this good. I always wind up accidentally eating the entire pint in one sitting! So good"

The textures all come together to make this gelato such an indulgent treat!!! It reminds me of a frozen version of Banana Foster! So good!"
1_talenti,4,5.0,0.0,"Most Banana products have a artificial flavor, which isnt the best tasting. However this Gelato doesnt have that gross artificial taste. It was really good on its own but even more so with the caramel and shortbread. I honestly wish there was more caramel because it really doesnt have a lot and you can barely taste it, had to add my own. But overall if you like Banana, you will like this! I recommend giving it a shot."

Then my daughter tried it and ate all the dulce de leche but I didnt even mind, the banana pudding gelato and pie crust was incredible. The scarce left over caramel flavor was awesome too, next time Im going to hide it."

1_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is by far the best banana ice cream in the market. Im a big fan of the chunky monkey ice cream from Ben and Jerrys but the chocolate chunks are so big as well as the walnuts that it takes away from the experience of having something soft and creamy like ice cream should. But this Banana Carmel Crunch one is so soft, creamy and sweet with just the perfect amount of crunch. I highly recommend if you like banana desserts. YUM!"

I plan to work my way through your flavors. Only one is missing, that I always get when Im over there, and that is hazelnut gelato...extremely popular in Europe. I also appreciate that Im getting my moneys worth when I buy your product. Your containers are a full pint (16 oz.), a good 2 to 3 oz. more than the other brands which cost the same!

I suggested that we purchaseThis Brand and to my surprise, there were absolutely NO CHOCOLATE CHIPS in the Raspberry Chocolate chip ice cream I purchased tonight! I was so upset! I couldnt believe that Talenti would let me down like this. I may not be purchasing this again."
3_talenti,2,5.0,0.0,"I have had Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip before and it was one of my favorites, so thats why I know this isnt right. There are no chocolate chips in it. I thought maybe it was just the top half and the chocolate chips had settled farther down but no, there are no chocolate chips in it. I was surprised that when I came to the website there were other complaints up to a year ago and apparently it hasnt been fixed. Very disappointed in what I thought was a great product and a bit of false advertising now that I see it wasnt a one time thing. Its just not special unless it has the chocolate chips in it!"
3_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I picked it up on a whim, seen it one evening while shopping in OKC. I loved the flavor combinations already and when I got home. Yea, I waited that long, I wasnt let down at all. If I could change it or improve it? I would love to try this similar melody but with dark chocolate if ever possible. I will say this, I am generally not a fan of cold treats, but I will be trying other flavors."
3_talenti,3,9.0,1.0,I’m confused - there were no chocolate chips in my Black Rasberry gelato... not sure if I got a bad batch but I was very disappointed. The flavor is really good though.
3_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is my favorite Talenti, not too sweet like the other flavors, and the little chocolate chips are the right size, not too chunky, just tiny bits, almost like grind up nuts. My only complain is the recent change, or it seems to be recent change based on the reviews....the formula and distribution seem to have changed. The chocolate chips seem to be disappearing or melted into the ice cream that its just raspberry flavor ice cream, also it used to be available in all the stores, and now its really hard to find. Please honor the traditional recipe formula and make it more available again."
3_talenti,4,2.0,1.0,"Bought this flavor as it called out to me, especially due to the intense purple color. Anyways, when I first tried this, I recoiled and re-read the name. I only tasted the chocolate and asked two of my friends to try it as well; they told me the same. After trying it a few times, I taste the subtle hint of the black raspberry and then, just chocolate. I also had my friends confirm this as we tried to find the raspberry, haha. This experience wasnt bad as I enjoy chocolate. But if you were looking for the raspberry taste, skip out on this one. If youre looking for a chocolate taste, definitely try this one out."
3_talenti,4,2.0,0.0,It was smooth and creamy and satisfying. The chocolate chunks were perfect but I was a bit disappointed in the raspberry flavor. Here I saw this deep purple color and thought oh man I bet that is so good and honestly the raspberry flavor was lacking in my opinion. The mango had more intense flavor (the mango I got for my hunny) and so I was slightly disappointed. Ill try some other flavors and see if I dont find one that stands up to the mango. Dont get me wrong it is a delish dessert I just felt the raspberry was in the background when it should have been front and center.
3_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is almost perfect! I gave this flavor four stars because, even though it is really yummy, I would’ve liked the blackberry flavor to be a little stronger. I personally think the chocolate overpowered the blackberry. But don’t get me wrong, I definitely recommend it! And I would buy it again if I was in the mood for chocolate covered blackberries!! I paid for this product myself but I did it to participate in a campaign."

3_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,This is a perfect gift to take to a friend or shut-in because of the size and packaging. Everyone has loved the flavor and has been able to find room for it in their freezer. Soon you may find that this is another reason to visit the ones you love!
3_talenti,1,2.0,0.0,"Unfortunately, nasty is the first word that popped into my mind and out of my mouth when I first tried this gelato. I tasted no raspberry flavor whatsoever. Whatever flavor I did get was just disgusting, disgusting with chocolate chips. My dad didnt like this flavor either, but he ate the rest of it to avoid having it go to waste. Well both stick with Talentis other gelato flavors (good news for the people who like this flavor - more for them)."

3_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,My grandsons and I love it. We watch Bubble Guppies or Songebob Squarepants and finish the container before the show is over!
3_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"This flavour is amazing. I paired it with a bowl of fresh cherries. Raspberry, Chocolate Chip + Cherries = AWESOMESAUCE"
3_talenti,2,8.0,5.0,"The flavour is great, but the texture is so icey, it ruins the whole thing. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I wouldnt be surprised if they were all that icey since fruits have high water content and gelato has less fat than ice cream. The chocolate texture was weird too."
3_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"There was not a single chocolate chip, not one. I was very disappointed as I chose this flavor over some of my favorites. The label is deceiving as it states Raspberry Chocolate Chip"" I was pretty sure my husband and I had tried it before (with the chips) and loved it. Not so much this time."
3_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip is probably the most awesome flavor in existance. My hubby and I have been eating this flavor for over a year now after we first discovered it and have it at least two or three times a week. Unfortunately we are not seeing it in stores anymore :( Very sad :(
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive had similar products but nothing compares to this flavor. The raspberry gelato is smooth with a deep, rich flavor and the chocolate chips are not only perfectly delicious but theyre the perfect density. Some chips will be too thick, they barely melt in your mouth, and others are so thin, theyre constantly breaking or the flavor is being lost."
3_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,This is my favorite Talenti flavor! I love it. Its perfect for a night in watching a good film.
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is amazing, its so hard to find GOOD black raspberry chocolate chip ice cream/gelato. Its incredible and great dessert option if you have a stomach ulcer - no added lemon juice or anything too tart. The chocolate balances it out nicely. Highly recommend."
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Of all of the flavor a I have tried from this brand (6 or 7) this one is my absolute favorite. It is a bit difficult to decide if this is a fruity flavor or a creamy flavor but it is certainly the perfect compromise. I have made my entire family try it at least once!
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I used to get black raspberry ice cream from where I lived as a child. I now live in the deep south where it is very difficult to find black raspberry ice cream. This gelato has saved me from a life devoid of black raspberry. It is spectacular in my opinion.
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Ever since I discovered this Talenti flavor, Im only getting this one when buying ice cream/gelato. This one is the perfect balance of sweetness, fruit vs. chocolate and creaminess. I prefer it over any store bought or ice cream shop bought flavor."
3_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,Rasberry Chocolate Chip Delicious it is my favorite although lately been getting some with no chips. I buy these when they are on sale. I always have a least 10 in my freezer.
3_talenti,1,2.0,1.0,"Literally tastes like nothing, no raspberry taste at all. Has the chocolate chips but tastes like usual vanilla chocolate chip ice cream. Not reccomended"
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Amazing combination of black raspberry and chocolate. I bought it thinking I probably wont like it but I was wrong. Nothing compares, it is so yummy."
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is hands-down, my absolute favorite! I stock up when it’s BOGO so I can try to always have it in my freezer!"
3_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,I was really disappointed as the name is misleading... there are NO Chocolate Chip!! Or did I get a the one bad pint??
3_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,WHERE ARE THE CHIPS? EVERYTHING ELSE WAS GOOD. WE HAVE ONE MORE IN FREEZER AND IT LOOKS LIKE NO CHIPS EITHER.
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The mixture of chocolate chips and raspberry flavoring is so good. I absolutely loved every bite of it.
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Love love love the zing of Raspberry , every spoonful just makes my mouth soooo happy."
3_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Defiantly a good flavor. Would love more chocolate chips in it.
3_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,There were no chocolate chips in this. Im sad now.
4_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,This was the best thing I could have ever tasted. I never take the time to write reviews so this means a lot. If you love strawberry shortcake ice cream this is very similar. The oats are not hard but like softish and overall delicious. You have to get everything in one bite; it taste better!!!
4_talenti,5,23.0,1.0,It was like eating a dessert version of yogurt parfait. I normally dont like raspberry and only tried it because it reminded me of breakfast and I was amazed by how good it was. Give it a shot even if you dont like raspberry!
4_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,The black raspberry vanilla parfait was soo good! It had all the ingredients I’d want to add all in one container. I could eat a whole jar at once!
4_talenti,5,6.0,2.0,"Luscious black raspberry and dazzling vanilla gelato carefully cradle the true star in the most magnificent dessert advancement in modern human history - the seemingly simple, but extraordinarily irresistible blueberry sauce. Get your spoon, and prepare to have your life transformed."
4_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,Love the different textures and how creamy the ice cream is! Super refreshing!
4_talenti,4,3.0,0.0,Super refreshing and light! Great flavor and texture
4_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"It has great raspberry flavor, and the colors are also pretty; white, light pink and a little darker pink."
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This gelato is one of the best ice cream flavors I have ever had! I grew up in the south, and one of the biggest flavors my family incorporated into cooking was raspberry. This flavor immediately brings me back to all the great desserts my family used to make when I was younger. The vanilla is smooth and creamy, the raspberry is tart and sweet, and the cookie is crunchy and delectable. I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying this!"
4_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"I was very intrigued when Talenti came out with their new layers and they only had this flavor in my local grocery store, so of course I bought it. I wasn’t expecting much and OMG ITS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD. The crunch parts are my fav and are so good I cannot explain it."
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I lost my stomach due to stomach cancer completely. This is so amazing to me. It is absolutely delicious and so easy peasy on my digestive system!
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I ate this small pint in 10 mins y’all need bigger containers of these.
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Well balanced and I love the crunchy layers! Must buy in store.
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This was what I have been looking for THANK YOU so much
4_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Great flavor, creamy, love the gelato. My favorite"
5_talenti,5,19.0,3.0,This is my far my favorite dessert of all time . I have at least 5 in my deep freezer to make sure that I dont run out.
5_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,"This gelato is exactly as described - both the almond butter & honey are noticeable in the flavor. Its creamy and sweet, but not overpowering. The salt is clear in the flavor. Im sad that this is a special batch gelato and not available all of the time, because its so good! I actually dont eat ice cream very often, but could eat this every day. The ingredients are perfect! One note: the review page which is linked to the almond butter & honey gelato brings up the reviews for caramel apple pie gelato, which is not what I am reviewing. I received this product for free for testing from Influenster."
5_talenti,5,13.0,4.0,The Carmel apple pie gelato was Amazing. I really like the peices of apple and the crust included in the gelato. I think this is the one of the best ones . Definitely would purchase again
5_talenti,5,7.0,1.0,"I absolutely love this flavor especially since I love apple desserts. Its rich and creamy texture makes it melt in your mouth and before you know it, its all gone!"
5_talenti,5,18.0,0.0,"This is maybe your best flavor, so why did you make it seasonal? It used to be available year round, and I would buy it all the time. With all due respect, limiting it to a certain time of year seems dumb."
5_talenti,5,5.0,2.0,Best Apple Pie Ice Cream Ive ever had. I love the chunks of apple and crust.
5_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,Gelato caramel apple pie recipe number 29 I am so sad that this gelato is not available the whole year this is truly an American delight who cannot resist the mouse awarding taste of apple pie all year long They should be on the shelves every day so people can enjoy it on July 4 on memorial day on Christmas my birthday I rather have gelato Carmel apple pie then cake So for the owners of the company please can you save this flavor for all year round flavor it’s so good it just can’t be done during holidays
5_talenti,5,4.0,2.0,Sooooooo good .... just wish it had more pie crust and less caramel ... but first spoon had me hooked
5_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"Ive tried a lot of different ice creams and gelatos in my almost 30 years of life but Ive never had a favorite one until now. Caramel Apple Pie Gelato has now won that spot. First off I love caramel and apple pie is my favorite kind of pie. I love that its not too sweet, that the pieces of Apple arent are huge chunks and that the bits of pie crust are still crunchy. Its absolutely delicious."
5_talenti,5,7.0,1.0,Thank you so much for creating this kind of ice cream. Out of all of the ones I tasted...you have finally got my heart with this one! I go to the store just for this apple pie ice cream... all of them are tasty..well at least the ones Ive tried...but this Caramel Apple Pie truly has my heart.
5_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"Ive heard of people dreaming of food in their sleep and waking up to rummage thru the fridge, but Ive never experienced something so bizarre until I tried Talenti Caramel Apple Pie Gelato!! There I was in the super market browsing the Ice cream section for a late night snack and I just so happen to come across this amazing Jar of Gelato, I decide to buy two one for me and one for me lol So I get home pop on the Hallmark Channel and crack that thing open and BOOM Im hit with a EXPLOSION a BLAST of AMAZING FLAVORS the Sweet and Smooth Caramel, Creamy Ice Cream, Crunchy Pie Crust, Sweet yet Sour dried Apples and the Swirls of Cinnamon and Sugar that took me back to my Grandmas kitchen my Happy Place where Ied eat Warm Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream!!! Honestly its the best Gelato Ive ever had, cravings and Midnight snack runs all because of Telentis Caramel Apple Pie Gelato!!!!!!"
5_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,this caramel apple pie gelato is all you will ever need to feel complete. the cinnamon sweetness will make your spirit soar. the apple pie chunks will make your heart swoon. my heart is broken that this is seasonal because i really feel i need it year round !!
5_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,this flavor is so delicious that I have to search for it in at different stores its so delicious. I have not been able to locate it here in Charlotte North Carolina
5_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"This ice cream is an American summer in a jar. The cinnamon based gelato is just right- not too overpowering and not too sweet. The caramel swirls, apple pieces and pie crust chunks are the perfect additions. I usually cant stand more than a few bites of any ice cream because of sweetness overload, but I nearly ate the whole thing in one sitting. The ONLY thing I was wishing for was for more pie crust pieces."
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Ive tried multiple flavor profiles from talenti and theyre all good but this one is by far the best flavor but with that being said it seems to be the hardest flavor to find Ive drove to multiple stores and they either dont sell this flavor or its sold out when ever i do see it its a must to stock up on a few
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This flavor is so delicious it is almost difficult to understand! Its apple pie a la mode all in one container. It is cool & refreshing, but with warm cinnamon and caramel flavors. Its rich & creamy with deep layered flavor. The crisp bits of crust give nice little bites as you eat. It is perfect!"
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I have been eating Talenti gelato for years. This was the first time I tried the caramel apple pie. It is heavenly. The flavor of the apple pie is perfect. It tastes exactly like apple pie with ice on top, except the pie is in the ice cream. It is perfect treat after a stressful week."
5_talenti,4,6.0,3.0,"I loved the ice cream it taste great. The only thing I didnt like was the apple pieces that are in it. They tasted rubbery, idk if it was just the one I had or not, but I loved everything else about it!"
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This is my FAVORITE Talenti flavor!! The flavor is so genuine. It really is like eating apple pie. I love the little bits of apple. I actually feel like Im eating something healthy when I have this haha! Love love love this flavor.
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Thank u Talenti! I notice that you guys put MORE pie crust in this flavor. Thank God! At first there was barely any but now...I give this 5 stars! I just ate the whole pint in one sitting. Very flavorful..tastes just like pie.
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,I think this is the best Gelato I have ever had! It tastes like home made apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. I keep it hidden for my own personal enjoyment! It doesnt take much to satisfy my sweettooth.
5_talenti,3,2.0,0.0,"This flavor is sooo good BUT they need to add more chunks, there are barely any in there which is super disappointing. Its the same with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough flavor."
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I love, love, love this flavor. Ive been to every supermarket looking this flavor as soon as I get my hands on it. Ima get at least five of them"
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is easily the best tasting gelato ever, creamy full of flavor. the apple bits and crust are the stars of this flavor."
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Greatest ice cream ever! I wouldnt change a thing about except I wish there was more!!
5_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Carmel swirl, apple chunks, pie crust. Delicious. Nothing else I have to say."
5_talenti,4,2.0,0.0,Ice cream is good it makes me wanna go back for more
5_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"The flavors of this gelato are exactly as described. I typically wouldn’t go for them but wanted to branch out, as I was given the pint for free in order to review via Influenster. It has a strong aftertaste that didn’t sit well with me. The flavors were amazing while actually eating it but afterwards was buttery. For the price, I wouldn’t purchase this particular flavor again ."
5_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,About 3 years I tried this and was very impressed Each spoonful tasted like a bite of pie. The crust pieces are small and there are very few. They are not as crisp either.The pumpkin pie reminded me of this gelato because of the chunks.If they were going to change it they should have reduced the sugar. Overall the flavor was good and the texture was smooth.
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is the pinnacle of human development on the dessert frontier. I personally love it with more pie crust than Apple bits but its truly a gift either way. My only gripe is I find some of the stores around me no longer have it in their talenti selection, and no one around me has it in the quart size... That would be too good to be true."
5_talenti,4,4.0,2.0,The ONLY thing I would change is give it less Apple pieces and more pie crust pieces
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the perfect mix of gelato and goodies added in. The cinnamon isnt overpowering,the caramel adds a yummy sweetness. The apples were a little soft and chewy but still good. The pie crust was soft and helped counter the sweetness. I usually hate pie because of the crust but in this its my favorite part!"
5_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I’m a big fan of gelato, so creamy. The almond butter & honey is a limited flavor, since we love almond butter, we gave it a go. It’s got more of a hint of almond butter, you could taste the honey, which gave it its sweetness. It was good, but I will try another flavor next time."
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Caramel Apple Pie is one of my go to holiday flavors. Im very big on apples and caramel. Its my go to snack. Me and my son enjoy spending quality time and eating our talenti gelato while watching movies on the weekend. His favorite is peppermint bark or mint chocolate chip.
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"LITERALLY tastes like apple pie with a scoop of melty vanilla ice cream on top! Plenty of chunks of frozen apple and pie crust, which enhances how realistic it is. The best frozen treat ive ever had"
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The pieces of real apple is the best part and the actual pieces of pie crust is the cherry atop the this wonderful sundae of a concoction.
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Its just beautiful..do not attempt to share. Uhmm..I get shy just talking about this flavor. Now tears are in my eyes. :-(
5_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I’m never going back to regular ice cream omg this stuff is amazing now all I need is some cookies and cream ones made

6_talenti,1,57.0,16.0,"Carmel Cookie Crunch use to be my favorite flavor ice cream I bought it every day for the past two years now. I noticed the past few times I bought it , it tasted odd/bad I thought maybe it was bad so I went to a different store and bought another of the same. That one tasted fine then the next day same thing tasted odd so I compared the two the recipe they changed it up. They must have there is a difference in saturated fat one is 6g 30% the newer one is 7g 35% and the ingredients is different as well. I don t know why they changed it Im very disappointed with the flavor now I had to throw 3 pints in the trash."
6_talenti,4,6.0,0.0,I really love everything about the Talenti ice cream. It taste very light and refreshing. The cookie chunks inside with the Carmel is so Devine. I have never tried this ice cream Before but my only regret is not trying it sooner. I will be trying other flavors as I am sure they will be just as good. I really like thay the cookies are not hidden as other ice creams contain very small pieces that blend in with the ice cream. With Talenti you can taste the crunch and I love that about it. It’s very smooth and creamy as well. i give it four stars because of the price. I feel it should be a bit cheaper. I received this product free for testing purposes.
6_talenti,3,7.0,4.0,"i have bought 3 pints of this stuff and all 3 had the same problem, there is no caramel swirl in the pint itself, just on the outside to make it look like there is. the texture isnt right either, its definitely not a authentic gelato texture"
6_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"This is the first Talenti flavor I’ve eaten...It’s SO good. I have to stop myself from eating the whole thing! If the other flavors are as good as the Caramel Cookie Crunch, I definitely need to try them! The ingredients are really simple and the price is on par for the quality. I received this complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster."
6_talenti,5,37.0,2.0,This flavor tastes super good! I would go ahead and buy more for my kids and its good thing that they sell this stuff at Sprouts!
6_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"So I’ve always eaten ice cream or custard (if you’re not from the Midwest maybe you haven’t had the pleasure that is custard but you should go find yourself some ASAP and thank me later!) but never went out of my way for gelato - why, I don’t know and I sure was missing out because this stuff is pretty awesome!! It is more dense than ice cream, but I liked the creamy texture and the flavor was great! I’m not going to lie, I’m a little bummed this has corn syrup in it! Other than that, I loved this product. This just may replace ice cream in my house - kids and hubby loved it too and it makes me feel less guilty since I found I eat less of this than ice cream - score! I did receive this product free for testing but these opinions are 100% my own!"
6_talenti,4,2.0,1.0,This is my first time trying the Talenti gelato. I personally liked the taste of the caramel cookie crunch. The taste is perfect its not to sweet. I really liked the taste overall of the chocolate pieces of cookies with the caramel. I received this product free for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.
6_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"The base is s creamy and sweet. The caramel is just a great addition, and cookie chunks make everything better. Whats not to love?"
6_talenti,2,3.0,0.0,"Im about half way through and havent seen a speck of caramel inside this thing. From the outside it looks like it would be full of caramel, but its just an ultra thin layer around the outside of the container. Theres so little I literally cant even taste it. Two stars because its still pretty good."
6_talenti,5,6.0,1.0,This was my wifes and my first Talenti experience. And… We devoured it. I had to check out the website for additional flavors. We have our next victim picked already.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Out of the Talenti gelatos I have tried so far, this one is my favorite. I like the crunch from the little cookie bits along with the hint of caramel. I was surprised that the cookie bits were so crunchy the first time I tried this flavor. I did get a disappointing surprise the last time I got one - all the caramel/dulce de leche was at the bottom of the container. Still, that one off wont prevent me from buying more in the future. However, I will check the entire container more carefully before buying it."
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Ive never had anything from Talenti before, but Ive always eyed it up. My husband brought some home today and I was super excited to try it because the only other Gelato Ive had has been amazing. Its like I left milk in the freezer far too long. Almost 0 flavor, and the texture was as if it was freezer burnt. The tiny bit of caramel that existed was only on the outside, and the teeny tiny pieces of cookie were too small and sparse to help the lack of flavor otherwise. Had the gelato itself had flavor, the cookie size and portion would be acceptable. Wondering if I should try any other flavors, because now I have a rather pricey pint of garbage in my freezer."
6_talenti,1,8.0,2.0,"I have been eating Testing for years and CCC was the very first flavor that started my love affair with this brand. I purchased a pint of CCC last week as was so excited to dig in. However, after the first spoonful I could taste the difference. The texture is waaaay off now. Also, the cookie bits have been replaced with some rock-like chocolate tasting balls of misery. Just to make sure I wasnt crazy, I pulled out an empty container of a previous CCC pint and compared the ingredients. Im not sure WHY you changed it but please change it back."
6_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is literally the best ice cream Ive ever had! Its way better than Blue Bell, which is something I never thought Id say. Im so glad I took a friends advice on purchasing this and now I tell everyone I know to try it. This is definitely one the best investments Ive made in a while and couldnt be happier with the results!"
6_talenti,1,9.0,1.0,"I’ve been a huge fan of Talenti for many years, so I decided to try the Caramel Cookie Crunch flavor for the first time. Upon opening and consuming at home, I discovered that the container is 95 percent cookie crunch (not the main draw for me), with caramel drizzled only on the outside of the container (total fake-out, making you think it’s layered through the entire pint). So, it’s really just vanilla with tiny bits of cookie, barely any caramel. Not impressed."
6_talenti,1,8.0,0.0,"I have always loved Talenti Caramel Cookie Crunch Gelato. I bought two pint containers, one Vanilla the other CCC. I couldnt wait to have some. Once we opened it I noticed that the gelato smelled different. I checked the expiration date and it was fine. So I had a scoop and my taste buds had a rude awakening. It tasted nothing like the gelato I loved."
6_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"The tiny chocolate balls can hardly be called ""cookie"" and the only caramel in it is thinly drizzled on the container sides with none actually IN the gelato. Very disappointed with this flavor."
6_talenti,3,5.0,3.0,So Caramel Cookie Crunch is my favorite flavor that Talenti carries. But when I got home to eat mine there is literally NO cookie crunch in my pint. It is just caramel. :( Im very disappointed.
6_talenti,3,8.0,0.0,Please go back to your old recipe. This is my very favorite ice cream and youve made a very small change and its not as good. Please change it back!!!!!
6_talenti,1,5.0,0.0,"This flavor use to be my all time favorite, I would eat like 2 pints per week. Recently I noticed the flavor was different, and I thought the first time it just went bad/expired. But I saw another review with the same complaint.. aparently they changed the recipie. Im very dissapointed :("
6_talenti,2,5.0,0.0,"Fans of Talenti for two years, my husband and I have noticed that the amount of caramel in the Caramel Cookie Crunch has been reduced. The last two times we purchased it; we were very disappointed. Maybe a good thing since summer is coming and we need to lose weight."
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Amazing! With just the right about of sweetness and crunch this ice cream is by far the best caramel cookie ice cream I ever had!
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the best flavor ! I love cookies and cream and this has the crunch, the caramel makes it nice and sweet"
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,If Talenti stopped making this flavor I would riot in the streets! #complentary #contest #honestreview
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Cant believe Ive lived this long without this in my life! It is so good, and Im now addicted."
6_talenti,1,3.0,0.0,I was not impressed. Hardly any caramel and the cookie pieces were specs and didnt add much. this was my first flavor of trying talenti and I was very disappointed. had no desire to finish container. overly priced for bad experience. Maybe i just over hyped this in my head and expected it to be amazing. I am sad to say i would not recommend this product
6_talenti,2,3.0,0.0,"I have been buying this flavor for a few months but like another reviewer I have recently found that the flavoring is off. The past 2 times I have bought this flavor it tastes as tough the milk used in the product is bad, or something else is off. I had really enjoyed this product and I hope this is just a problem with a batch or two."
6_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,Tonight I tried the Caramel Cookie Crunch for the first time. It looked so good before it was opened. It looked like it had quite a bit of caramel. All of the caramel in it is what you see on the outside of the container. I thought it would be swirled throughout. There was such a small amount of caramel that I inly tasted it in two bites. It was very disappointing seeing as the caramel was the whole reason I purchased it!
6_talenti,1,2.0,0.0,"I am a huge fan of Talenti and tried the caramel cookie flavor for the first time this weekend. Its ... not right. Something about it tastes wrong and I cannot place it. I immediately thought the milk was bad, but some bites actually taste good. It has a good aftertaste but eating it is almost gross. None of the other favors are weird like this so Ill toss this batch and go back to my other favorites."
6_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"when I first started buying this gelato it was fabulous. Within the past few months, however, it has fallen off in quality. The flavor is great, but not much caramel. In fact, the last pint I just opened had only a spec of caramel-prompting me to send this review. It had so little it could have been called cookie crunch. Have you changed this product?"
6_talenti,1,5.0,2.0,I have been enjoying the Caramel Cookie Crunch for about a year. The other day I purchased 2 and couldnt believe the flavor change. I cant tell you what made the difference but it wasnt tasty and I will not be purchasing this product in the future.
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Incredibly disappointing. The only caramel to be found were tiny dribbles along the side of the container making it look like caramel was a primary component. Once the container was purchased and opened, it was a real let down with barely a hint of caramel. It was a generic vanilla with a few cookie pieces and not much else. Talenti, if ""Caramel"" is the first word on the label I would expect it to taste like caramel. Ill never buy this flavor again.

6_talenti,1,3.0,1.0,"Why does gelato need flour? I let my guard down, thinking errously, that gelato and ice cream surely did not have flour in them. Well, when I woke up with blisters I reviewed what Id eaten. Somewhere there had to had to have been flour. I was surprised and disappointed to find yet another company uses flour as a filler."
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I typically love Talenti ice cream, but I ventured out to try this flavor and was so disappointed! There was hardly any caramel or cookie crunch. It tasted like plain vanilla. I didnt even finish it. This ice cream is just too expensive to leave feeling disappointed. I am such a huge ice cream lover and have loved all the other flavors I tried, but wish I didnt have this bad experience because it makes me not want to try any new flavors!"
6_talenti,3,2.0,0.0,I was really excited to try this but was disappointed in the amount of caramel and cookies. Most of the caramel was at the bottom not throughout the gelato & I wish there was more of a crunch with the cookies
6_talenti,1,2.0,0.0,This used to be my favorite flavor from Talenti but lately it just hasnt been the same. The ice cream itself tastes different and theres hardly any caramel or cookie bits. Really bummed.
6_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"Ive never had Talenti before and I wont buy again. The dulce de luche swirl is a joke, its just a few ribbons on the side of the container to make it look like its there, but thats it. Also, the texture of the gelato was not rich and creamy, it had a looser, thinner texture that I associate with light ice cream. Finally, the cookie pieces were really tiny so you couldnt even taste them."
6_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I do really enjoy this flavor, but the look of the outside is a little bit misleading. It shows a lot of swirls of caramel, but when youre actually eating it, youll notice that the caramel swirls are ONLY on the outside and not in the middle, so you dont really get much of it. Dont get me wrong, its still amazing! But I wish there was more caramel."
6_talenti,1,3.0,2.0,I buy Talenti every week and I enjoy trying new flavors so I decided to try Caramel Cookie Crunch. This was the worst kind of ice cream I have ever tasted from Talenti. It has a foul smell and taste to it and I had to throw it away. I am very upset I had to spend the money just to throw it away.
6_talenti,1,3.0,2.0,"Every couple of months, I buy the Caramel Cookie Crunch flavor, thinking I love it. Wrong. Its pretty bad. Plain vanilla, tiny little pieces of cookie, and a whiff of caramel. What should be ""sinful"" is actually boring. With some tweaks to the recipe, this could be a homrun."
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"This was my fav ice cream for a long time, recently a change was made and the taste is absolutely horrid! I have jad to throw away three pints because I kept trying them thinking something was wrong with my taste, but then I saw other reviews and realized something has changed! Please please change it back to the original!"
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I try to not get the same flavor twice so decided to give this a try. The caramel (reason I decided on this flavor) to ice cream (I dont like vanilla on its own) ratio seemed very off to me. I would have liked for the caramel to be much more apparent.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"this is one of the best gelato i have ever had and i live in winston salem, North Carolina and we dont have not that many gelato in winston salem, north carolina as it is that you can buy in the store that is as good as this brand of gelato/ice cream."
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"This gelato has essentially a couple pieces of cookie crunch and some caramel squirted on the side to make it look like it’s ful of stuff. Very disappointing. If I wanted vanilla gelato, I would have bought it. What a waste and very misleading."
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,The caramel had a very liquid consistency and artificial flavor in a bad way. The vanilla is ok but has an almost icy like texture. I don’t remember other talenti gelato being this way. Will stick with other brands from now on.
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Was our family’s favorite ice cream to eat in a daily basis until they changed the recipe about a year ago. Thought the pints we bought were bad until we realized it was all of them...wish the old recipe would be brought back.
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Bought first pint of talenti and thought it was expired. It tasted like watermelon juice and that is not what this should taste like. The flavor was very off. Would not recommend. Very sad for this to go to waste.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this icecream on a whim. Sometimes a flavor of icecream sounds better than it tastes. This choice was different. Its absolutely delicious and I plan to purchase it again.
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"This sucks, it has no Carmel flavor and it taste like water down milk. So far this is the second gelato I’ve taste from this brand and neither are good. The jus lack in flavor"
6_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Tastes like something is wrong with it. It is not expired. I checked. Tastes like watermelon. Maybe the wrong flavoring got added. There is no way this is how it should taste.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Much better than ice cream! Cant wait to buy more! Love love love love! Usually a cookies and cream fan but this blows it out of the water.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I would eat this every day if I could. I tried this ice cream a few months ago and I can’t stop eating it. It’s is the best ice cream ever.
6_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,My first time having this and it’s so good Ready to try more flavors
7_talenti,5,26.0,6.0,Ok so Im so addicted to this ice cream its not even funny!! I am literally in need off some right now been driving around liking for some and cant find them because their sold out everywhere!! The best! These are the containers I finished in less than a week!! Its getting serious!v the addiction is real! Please make bigger sizes! Thank you for making such a great flavor!
7_talenti,5,11.0,2.0,"I opened the container and first noticed the creamy texture and delicious aroma. I filled my spoon full of the heaven on earth flavor... Im hooked. I cant get enough. I need my ""fix"" everyday, even if its just a spoonful.. but who am I kidding... I can never stop at a spoonful. Before I know it, its gone. My son tried to eat a small portion but I gave him the directions to the nearest store to get his own stash. I will not share this. Its my precious!! I finally admitted I have an addiction today. I have a problem. Hi, my name is Karen and Im a Caribbean Coconut addict."
7_talenti,5,14.0,2.0,"My son had thus, so I tried it. I dont even like coconut and this was amazing. Had to force myself to stop eating it or I would have polished the whole container off. Yum!"
7_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I think this is he best coconut Gelato Ive had. After reading the reviews of ""no coconut"" flavor I was in somewhat disbelief. Ive lived on a coconut farm for nearly 20 years. This taste like a fresh coconut. My assumption is that those that cannot taste it are either smokers or used to artificial coconut flavored cookies and snacks. By far the best coconut ice cream product Ive had!"
7_talenti,5,11.0,4.0,This flavor is literally the greatest flavor that has entered my mouth since I was born! I am in my mid 30s and have never found a perfect blend of flavors until now. I cannot recommend this enough!
7_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"It is so decadent, it lifts my mood with every spoonful. This is one of those items you stumble upon once in a blue moon and never let go.  Oh and what about the container in comes in, I use them to store sugar packets, seasonings, etc... Theyre air tight and perfectly suited for RV. Ive purchased the larger size at big box store.  So yummy!!!:)"
7_talenti,4,4.0,1.0,"Every bite has tons of ground coconut, really yummy. This is very soft gelato, very easy to skim layer by layer. I do wish this had either vanilla bean, or pineapple, this would just be amazing if it had either or."
7_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I am from the Caribbean and this ice cream reminds me of the days when my parents used an ice cream bucket with turn handle to make the best ever coconut ice cream. Please dont change a thing, just add grape nut and rum and raisin flavors to your line up and I will be in heaven."
7_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"I went to Italy for two weeks last year. A family member who went to Italy before said one of our goals should be to eat gelato everyday we were there. We almost made that goal. The talenti Caribbean Coconut flavor is exactly like the best coconut gelato I experienced while in Italy. Thank you talenti for great texture, quality, and flavor here in America."
7_talenti,3,4.0,3.0,"Dont get me wrong. Is super smooth, sweet and delicious... but it is more of a vanilla flavor than coconut itself. I was craving the coconut and is just not there. :("
7_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is by far the most incredible tasting dessert Ive ever had outside of a 5 star restaurant. The flavors are so simple and pure. Just exquisite!
7_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is by far the best ice cream (gelato) I have eaten. I have tried several Talenti flavors, all are good, but this is my favorite."
7_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Best thing I probably have tasted in YEARS. Thanks for a great product Talenti!
8_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"Given the price point and that its Talenti, I was expecting this to be amazing. It is good but didnt meet expectations. Also, there arent actually layers. The cherry chocolate part, which is the best part by far, is only around the outside edge of the jar and not an actual layer."
8_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,So good! Mix of gelato and crunchy cheesecake. You can really taste the cream cheese coming through.
8_talenti,3,6.0,1.0,"I agree with many others, to call this ‘layers’ is deceiving because the ‘layers are actually only around the perimeter of the jar. Everything in the center is gelato and no layers. I was surprised by this once I started spooning the gelato layers out of the jar and into a bowl. The ratio of ingredients aren’t bad but it does appear by looking at it in the store and the description on the jar and on the website that there are true layers. If the name was changed to exclude the word ‘layers’ I believe customers would not be as critical and feel like this was not false advertising. Definition of a layer: a sheet, quantity, or thickness of material, typically one of several, covering a surface or body........that’s my two cents"
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This talenti reminds me of the cheesecake factorys Chocolate Cherry oheesecake, which came out last year with the Cinnabon cinnamon swirl cheesecake."
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Great Product! I will definitely be purchasing again and spreading the word to my friends how good this treat is for dessert.
8_talenti,2,3.0,1.0,"I dont buy a lot of ice cream, gelato, or sweets in general, but occasionally I have a desire for some dessert. This brand is one of my go tos when Im looking at ice cream. Chocolate cherry cheesecake sounds great, but this wasnt so good and I wont buy it again. Its been a couple weeks since I had it. First, it didnt taste a whole lot like cheesecake. Im not sure how to describe it. Cheesecake-like? It wasnt a bad flavor, just not what I was expecting. The cherry part was actually pretty good, but I dont even remember any chocolate flavor. The problem is there is a light coconut flavor in the entire jar, and the cookie bits at the bottom have a heavy coconut flavor. I dont like coconut, so as soon as I dug in, thats all I noticed."
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I love this flavor I can’t get enough of it! When I go to the store it’s a must have.
8_talenti,5,8.0,1.0,i didnt know i was attracted to food until i had this gelato
8_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"The top layers are great. Tastes like cheesecake until you hit the bottom layer. Doesn’t taste like graham crackers at all. More like coconut cookie crumbs. Taste is not bad, its just not great since it dominates over every layer flavor wise. How about some really graham crackers"
8_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"Far better than the vanilla fudge one, this has a multitude of flavors that really build on each other. It does have all the flavors of a cherry cheesecake with some chocolate added. Well done and extremely tasty."
8_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"So creamy and delicious cheesecake layer, followed by a cherry sauce with crunchy dark chocolate chips!!! Finished a whole jar in two days! Gotta go get more!!!"
8_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Omg! New favorite flavor! Sweet ice cream on a delectable layer of chocolate cherry layer. Cheesecake sweetness
8_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Has sweet, tart, salty, and all the key components"
8_talenti,5,4.0,2.0,"Really delicious flavor. The cheesecake ice cream is nicely paired with cherry sauce and perfect amount of chocolate chips. Dug the spoon all the way down to get all the layers in one spoonful, perfection!"
8_talenti,3,2.0,1.0,"I was really excited to try this flavor but was pretty disappointed in the lack of the cherry sauce to ratio of everything else :( wouldn’t recommend if you’re really looking for cherry cheesecake, it’s mostly cheesecake. But hey I still ate all of it bc who doesn’t love cheesecake We appreciate your feedback - were disappointed that you did not have a great experience with our Talenti Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake Layers. We would be happy to assist you further. Please reach out to us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com. We look forward to hearing from you."
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My daughter never tries anything new, and when she does she usually rejects it immediately. This is the first new flavor she has tried in a very long time and she is in love. The down side is I will never be able to enjoy this amazing gelato alone ever again."
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I personally dont care for chocolate, but after skipping that layer, this was good. I like the Graham crakers at the bottom way better than the oats in the raspberry one. The cheesecake gelato was sooo creamy, way better than the vanilla."
8_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,All of your flavors are such high quality and wonderful tasting. The only problem is that you continue to use coconut oil and it overpowers the entire taste the gelato. I hope you can find a substitute for that horrible coconut flavor.
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Recently saw the ""layers"" line and couldnt wait to try it. The cheesecake gelato is the best Ive ever tasted. Wish there was more cherry filling, but overall it was great. Cant wait to try other flavors!"
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Its like cheesecake party in your mouth. All the savoiry flavors the cherry oh its not too sweet my gosh mixed with the dark chocolate thats not too bitter. Oh goodness gracious me. It is simply perfection
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Omg so delicious! You can taste all of the flavors, especially the cream cheese. I love talenti...my friend and I purchase it almost every time we are at the grocery store. Hands down the best!!!"
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this so much I""m a truly in love !!!! I just love every layer & the amount of flavor busting from each layer is AMAZING!!!! Hands down my favorite Talenti i could eat it daily !!!"
8_talenti,5,3.0,2.0,This product is so delicious! I love this flavor and Raspberry cheesecake
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"WOW! This brand is a revolution in flavor, each one came through LOUD and CLEAR to the delight of my tastebuds. I am a fan, and to think I almost didnt try it."
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,It needs a bit. More cherry. That is the only downside but man that is DELICIOUSLY ADDICTIVE
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I loved it. Especially the chocolate chunks. I just wish the Graham crackers were chewier.
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I thought it was delicious and creamy. I also liked how all the layers go together
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I live Talenti. It’s all I eat but these layered ones are seriously to die for!!!!
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Finished it in one night. Amazing . The flavors go amazingly awesome together
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I tried it and I fell in love!!! It’s so true to the flavor of cheesecake.
8_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,Tastes great except there was absolutely no chocolate in there whatsoever!
8_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,I know what true munchies are I hate but love it sooo muchhh
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Amazing flavor profiles with perfect amount of everything.
8_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,One of the best mixture of flavors I have ever tasted
9_talenti,4,41.0,3.0,"Im halfway done the pint of chocolate chip cookie dough gelato and its been all vanilla and some chocolate against the side. theres no cookie dough, but a lot of stuff on the bottom"
9_talenti,2,53.0,5.0,"I cant believe that I just emailed the company about the fact that there were only 2 cookie dough chunks in the entire container. Then I come here to check reviews and see that this is an ongoing issue and I wasnt crazy. The name Choc Chip Cookie Dough is extremely INCORRECT. How about Vanilla fudge swirl... I dug around hoping to find all the cookie dough chunks huddled together at the bottom... NO SUCH LUCK. Before asking ""what we can do to improve"".. How about reading these reviews and make some changes or let us know that you are aware of our concerns. Stock replies are so disappointing. My opinion.... try a different flavor."
9_talenti,1,11.0,0.0,"I thought this gelato was very disappointing. It was my first time trying it so maybe a different flavor would be better? It tastes nothing like real gelato. More like watered down ice cream or ice milk. It is missing the decadence of gelato. I’m not sure if people giving it positive reviews have ever tried gelato? This isn’t it. I’m curious to try one more time with a different flavor. This one tasted a like plastic or chemicals and didn’t have enough pieces of cookie dough to be called cookie dough. For the price, this was a huge disappointment. Ben & Jerry’s is the same price (both are $3.50 at my grocery store) and has big chunks of cookie dough. It’s so much more satisfying. Skip this one."
9_talenti,1,14.0,3.0,"I was pretty disappointed by this gelato. I have tried some of the other Talenti flavors and really enjoyed them. Unfortunately, this one was sub par and I wish I didnt waste my money...or calories for that matter. The last review I saw on this website was from 11 months ago, and yet there was still hardly any cookie dough. This isnt one of my go to flavors, but today it sounded like it would hit the spot. Instead all I got was vanilla with a hint of chocolate and not much else. I hope the company takes a listen and thinks about altering their recipe soon!"
9_talenti,1,6.0,1.0,It said chocolate chip cookie dough chunks but there wasn’t any chunks! Was super disappointed and mad at this false advertising since I didn’t get any chocolate chip cookie dough. Wouldn’t buy again.
9_talenti,2,3.0,0.0,I love ice cream but how is there a whole bunch of ice cream but no cookie dough. Like really you guys need to fix this I would rather have more cookie dough than anything.
9_talenti,1,10.0,3.0,I love most talenti flavors and I love chocolate chip cookie dough ice creams in general so I got excited when I saw this flavor available at my local store. However I was immediately disappointed with the extreme lack of cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips. It tasted more like a mild version of vanilla ice cream into which a few bits of dough and chocolate accidentally fell in. This flavor needs HUGE improvements and I would happily purchase a new version of it if it were ever re-done.
9_talenti,2,9.0,2.0,"Yea, there was some cookie bits in there, but it was so...so so small but tasty. The main problem was the taste. There were no chocolate CHIPS in there so all I could taste was vanilla and some dough here and there, no chocolate or anything else. Wont buy this again. I mean the general taste isnt bad but I wanted more of the Chocolatem the chips AND the cookie dough."
9_talenti,2,7.0,1.0,"My husband and I love Talenti and I was excited when I came across cookie dough however, we were disappointed not to find a single chunk of dough in our pint. We probably wont be trying this flavor again."
9_talenti,1,11.0,4.0,"We love Talenti and buy a couple pints a week. We tried the cookie dough variety tonight and were very disappointed to discover there were only two pieces of cookie dough in the entire pint. This pint should have been caught by quality control and rejected. I am not exaggerating, there were literally only two pieces."
9_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"honestly I dont know where to begin. after a tough day I head to the grocery store and I am pleasantly surprised to see this flavor. the gelato was even on sale. I went for it, expecting to be nourished by the wonderful taste of good ol talent ice cream. however, upon opening it I noticed vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls. not what I had been expecting. I give it a try and within the first bite I am extremely disappointed and almost brought to tears. what I expected to cheer up my day, only brought be down even more. this is not chocolate chip cookie dough gelato. this is mediocre vanilla ice cream with swirls of what tastes like Hershey chocolate syrup only on the side of the bin. there were also not nearly enough pieces of cookie dough to be advertised in the flavor. in conclusion, I am very disappointed in a brand I once loved and will not be buying this flavor again."
9_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,The ice cream was delicious - great flavor. The only suggestion would be to make the cookie dough pieces bigger!
9_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"The vanilla base is good, as is the fudge swirl, but the cookie dough is next to nonexistent. I got a few tiny chunks and a little bit of swirl in my pint, the rest was all vanilla. Disappointing, since I figured that chocolate chip cookie dough would be a foolproof flavor."
9_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Talenti is by far my favorite brand. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Gelato is perfect- not too sweet, but has a delicious, light flavor that is sure to please your tastebuds! It has just enough bits of cookie dough so it doesnt overpower the taste of the gelato."
9_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,This is the best chocolate chip cookie dough frozen treat I have ever had! Most other companies pack a bunch of chocolate chips in vanilla and toss maybe 5 pieces of cookie dough in and call it a day but not this! Very creamy and satisfying. I almost never finish a pint at once but this was in no time. Will be buying again for sure!!
9_talenti,1,3.0,1.0,"just spent the last 10 minutes digging into a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough, looking for pieces of cookie dough and not finding a single one!!! yes, the vanilla ice cream tastes wonderful and the swirls of chocolate were yummy, too, but I want the bits of cookie dough! what a waste! sadly disappointed."
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,This is the second (and last) time I buy this flavor. My husband bought one a few months ago and commented that despite the name of the flavor there was no cookie dough actually in the container. We thought maybe it was just a bad batch or even worse luck so I bought another one recently. Again there was no dough to be found! Not one piece in the entire pint! So sad. I love Talentis other flavors but this one was a bust :(
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I love several other flavors, but this is the worst Talenti flavor and the worst chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream/gelato Ive ever had. I found 3 (very small) pieces of cookie dough in the whole container and ended up throwing half of it away. If I wanted vanilla gelato, I wouldve bought that. The reviews have consistently said this for 3 years so how is it still an issue? I want my money and calories back."
9_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"It looks like I had the same problem as mostly everyone else who left a review. This flavor is ok. I would like it more if it actually had a decent amount of cookie dough in it. Half way through the pint and I have only found two pieces of dough and I really had to search for them, which takes away from the joy of eating it. I have also had the same issue with the Apple Pie flavor, not enough chunks."
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Never have I been more disappointed in a pint of gelato! My pint was mostly vanilla gelato with chocolate swirls on the bottom and sides. Having had several Talenti flavors I know that a lot of their ""chunks"" tend to find their way to the bottom. However, this time i was fresh out of luck...no cookie dough pieces or even chocolate chips for that matter...not even 1! I want my money back!"
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I see our experience is not unique. Googles these reviews after amazingly going through the entire pint with literally zero cookie dough. Not just a couple of bits; not a small amount....literally zero. I promise you this is not exaggeration. I was only inclined to look up reviews and post one of my own after wondering why they would even market it as having cookie dough. Zero.
9_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"I just tried this for the first time, and I will never buy it again. I literally 4 tiny specs of cookie dough in the whole pint. Sure, the vanilla and little swirl of chocolate tasted good, but Im very disappointed because I expected A LOT more cookie dough!!! This should not be called cookie dough at all. Basically its just vanilla with a bit of chocolate syrup."
9_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Love all the flavors, but Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is my favorite. When I first discovered Talenti Gelato, I tried several flavors but cookie dough is my go to flavor. I would share my preference with friends and store clerks. Fateful mistake because now l cannot find it. Seems everyone likes it. But, Im always on the hunt for chocolate chip cookie dough."
9_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,Honestly have to say that this is the best cookie dough I have ever had & I would recpmned it to everyone!! FAV
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I absolutley love talenti gelato but its absolutely ridiculous how there were basically NO chunks of cookie dough. The few pieces I did get were smaller than the size of peas if that. Myself personally when eating cookie dough ice cream expect large chunks throughout the whole product. Would not recommend this flavor but definitely other flavors.
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I love the other flavors but was so disappointed in this pint. I dug to the bottom looking for a chunk of dough only to find none and the vanilla flavor wasnt very good to boot, I just threw it away. I figured my pint was an anomaly but after reading the other reviews on this site I have to ask, why are you all withholding our cookie dough?!"
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I came here to make sure I’m not losing my mind because there are essentially no cookie dough chunks in the entire container. I’m seeing the same reviews from 3 and 4 years ago. You think something would change by now. Nope. Granted their blueberry crumble and pistachio flavors are amazing. This one honestly sucks.

9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"The name of this flavor is super misleading. It should really be called vanilla with chocolate. Theres barely any cookie dough, and the few pieces it does have are tiny. If youre looking for real cookie dough gelato....dont buy this brand. The other flavors Ive tried were great; disappointing."
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,If your looking for a vanilla ice cream with a hint off chocolate swirl this is the one for you. There wad 1 chunk of cookiedough in the entire pint. How disappointing is that? The fact that everyone else is saying the same thing should indicate they need to revisit the recipe. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback!

9_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"These pints are hit and miss. One had lots of gobs in it, another had maybe 3-4 pieces. Aside from that, the cookie dough pieces are of high quality and the vanilla ice cream is very good. Adding the swirl breaks up the plainness of the ice cream found in other brands."
9_talenti,1,2.0,1.0,"I was very excited about trying the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough gelato, but half way through the pint of ice cream I only got TWO chunks of cookie dough. I have NEVER had to leave a review on Gelato, but i felt like I needed to because of how unsatisfied I am."
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"As many other reviews have mentioned, this isnt really chocolate chip cookie dough. Its more like vanilla with the occasional chocolate swirl and the very, very rare chunk of cookie dough. I was disappointed in this flavor, and will not be purchasing it again."
9_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"I love cookie dough ice cream. And I love Talenti gelato, so this should be a no brainer. Not that it tastes bad, its just needs a change. Chocolate chips need added, remove the fudge swirl, and add more cookie dough pieces and I think it would be a winner!"
9_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"This gelato is pretty good, and what I love about is when you take it out of the freezer. It isnt even hard to get it out with a spoon, it was amazing but it tasted just like regular ice cream, but kind of better. Will be buying this again!!"
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Barely any cookie dough (if any) and just overall bad taste. This also happened w/another one of their products, the so called Raspberry and Chocolate Chip.. with no chocolate chips!! Although their Sea Salt Carmel is great."
9_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,I dont know why this one has such a low rating honestly. My gf and myself very much enjoy this flavor. For whatever reason it has fallen out of popularity and is nearly impossible to find these days.
9_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,Very little CCC dough flavor. It is overwhelmingly vanilla and not that it is bad but if I wanted vanilla Id have purchased that pint instead. A lot of work needs to be done with this flavor.
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Hardly any cookie dough. The few pieces I got tasted like freezer burned frozen ice cream. Zero chocolate chips. I tossed the rest. Never again will I buy this flavor. Please discontinue
9_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"The vanilla? Wonderful! Fudge swirl? Yes! Cookie Dough? Lacking. Overall I love this product and did eat it all on one sitting, but definitely needs more cookie dough chunks!"
9_talenti,1,2.0,1.0,Not in the ice cream. Not a single piece of cookie dough in the pint. Not one. All the chocolate swirl was on the bottom. This was a pint of vanilla. Disappointing.
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,More like vanilla with a touch of chocolate syrup. This is definitely not a chocolate chip cookie dough gelato. Dont be cheap. Put some actual cookie dough in it.
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I have eaten all of the ice cream and there hasnt been any cookie dough or chocolate chip pieces. The overall taste isnt very good either!
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Disappointed! Not enough cookie dough only 2 pieces??!! That is freaking ridiculous! I wish I can have my money back for this let down.
9_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,This stuff tastes great but... Where is the cookie dough!? There were like 5 small chunks. Id like a refund.
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"CLOYING SWEET, NO Cookie dough, lacks flavor. Looks good on the outside but not good on the inside."

9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Worst cookie dough ice cream ever. Where is the cookie dough? I cant find it!
9_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Definitely not enough cookie dough in this. It’s basically just vanilla gelato

10_talenti,3,8.0,0.0,"When this product is as it should be, its my favorite treat! However, about a month ago I purchased a chocolate peanut butter cup pint that had no peanut butter and no peanut butter cups in the entire pint. I thought it must have been a fluke and my family laughed about it. However, I now purchased a second pint that appears to have the same issue. We used half of it tonight and no one had any peanut butter or cups in their bowl, and I cant see a single one in whats left in the container. For the price of the product, its very frustrating for it to be so inconsistent. It might be time to find a new treat!"
10_talenti,2,7.0,1.0,"I used to love this flavor, but in an effort to scale back on the amount of sweets I eat, I havent purchased ice cream or gelato in quite some time. I was excited when I saw this on sale at Stop and Shop and bought some for old times sake. When I broke into it after dinner, I was disappointed. It was much sweeter than I remembered, the consistency was more like ice cream than gelato, the distribution of peanut butter cups was sparse, and there were very few spoonfuls of peanut butter. I dont know if the recipe has changed or if I just got some of a bad batch, but this was no bueno. Overall, Im just sad because I was looking forward to eating this so much. So let down was I that I felt compelled to come and leave a review. In the past I have loved your products, but after tonight, I will probably pass next time I see Talenti on sale, as this was my absolute favorite flavor."
10_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,I am in LOVE with the Talenti Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup!! It is my cover page on FaceBook!!! I find it interesting that others must feel the same. I feel lucky when I still see a couple in the freezer section. Please do not discontinue this one. There is one I loved when it first came out and I cant find it anymore. It was Toasted Almond. I use you empty containers to store all sorts of things! I tell everyone about your product and now have others hooked on it!! :o)
10_talenti,1,8.0,4.0,"Something seems to have changed. I used to love this flavor; however, I bought a pint this week and it was basically just milk chocolate ice cream (not creamy like gelato, very icy). There were hardly any peanut butter cups. In fact, in my first two servings I had zero. There were a few stuck to the bottom. They used to heap them in along with the peanut butter (hardly any PB spoonfuls now). I used to love this stuff but Id hesitate before purchasing again. Lets hope it was just a bad batch. Were sorry to hear about this! It sounds like your pint might have experienced some thaw/refreeze damage creating an icy texture and causing the pb cups to sink to the bottom. Please send us an email so we can make this right for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us"
10_talenti,5,3.0,2.0,"Amazing product. Flawless flavor! Im actually from Canada, and Im totally willing to cross the border just to buy more of this. Definitely recommend this for any peanut butter and chocolate lovers. This is the kind of sweet youll want a glass of water with. Also the selection of ingredients is really impressive. A natural ice cream for such a good price. You cant help but feel really happy while eating this. Thank you Talenti!"
10_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,So amazing. So delicious. We love this flavor here in Bermuda! Cheers to delicious experiences!
10_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Would I recommend this to a client? Heck yes I would. I honestly fell in love. Perfect creamy texture. The taste was the perfect combination of sweet and robust with notes of coffee. The first bite is like slipping on your favorite cashmere sweater. The subtle peanut butter swirls dance on your tongue. The mini peanut butter cups break up creaminess. For this particular characteristic, and this characteristic only, we are not so fond. 4/10. However, this minor flaw is easily overlooked in the midst of the dream like state that you go into when you eat this gelato. WARNING: It is easy to lose yourself while consuming this product, and you may forget that there is 4 servings per container, with each serving containing 29 g of sugar. Consume with caution. ADDITIONAL WARNING: your affections for your significant other may pale in comparison to your feelings toward this product. That is all."
10_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,This definitely is my FAVORITE Talenti flavor@ the chocolate with the thick peanut butter mixed in AAAAANd peanut butter cups?!? Perfect combination. If you havent tried it... go do so.. IMMEDIATELY.
10_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"Ice had this ice cream before and it was exactly as it stated "" mini peanut butter cups folded into milk chocolate gelato with swirls of peanut butter"" Not this time, it had zero peanut butter cups and 2 or 3 peanut butter swirls. There goes $4... I mainly buy it for the peanut butter cups inside. I used to recommend this product, but the last pint I bought was missing bits as well."
10_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"I really love peanut butter, but the past couple of times I’ve bought this there have been barely any PB swirls and markedly fewer peanut butter cups. Until I found a tiny swirl of peanut butter 2/3 of the way into my last jar, I actually thought Talenti had changed the recipe to no longer include swirled PB. Still love Talenti, won’t buy this flavor anymore."
10_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"I am love with this Gelato, my only frustration is its always sold out. It is my absolute favorite Treat in the world. If you have not tired it, its a must and dont say that about many food items."
10_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I really love the clash of chocolate and peanut butter together and the ice cream just melts in your mouth because its so smooth......
10_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,I really love the chocolate base but the peanut butter is a bit too strong. Its really salty but other than that its awesome.

11_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This has to be my very favorite desert, and would eat it a lot more if I could buy it. I go to Publix, BI-Low, Walmart, they all carry Talenti and have many flavors and all with a lot of inventory. Bi-Low had some Coconut Almond, but would run out. I would ask the stock people if they have more. In the back room and they would sy they cant keep it in stock? Id say if it sells out, double the order, because when I come in, they are out, but of plenty of other flavors. Other stores I go to and request they carry it and they say they will, I come in next time and they say they sold out. Why is this not telling the stores to order more if it sells out?"
11_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I found this flavor in Florida and tried it as a special treat. I was amazed at the delicious flavor! Lovely combination of coconut, almond and chocolate, perfection! I generally do not like added flavors to basic desserts, as many are overly sweet, killing your taste buds with too much sugar. This is a perfect light balance of flavors with a tiny bit of crunch. I have searched every local grocery in Michigan for this flavor. It’s hard to find here. I have submitted requests to grocers to add this flavor. I finally found it at Target yesterday! They had 8 jars and yes, I bought them all! Love,love,love!"
11_talenti,5,10.0,1.0,"Recently started shopping at a new grocery store that carries literally every flavor Talenti makes and I stumbled upon this Cocnut Almond Choc Chip. It might be my new favorite! Its light but so flavorful! When Im feeling recklessly indulgent I scoop a little portion of this, the hazelnut chocolate chip, and the chocolate sorbet; they all complement each other nicely."

11_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"I was introduced to Gelato when vacationing in Italy, I went to a shop that made Gelato right in front of you. Once I tasted this wonderful dessert I swore off ice cream. When I returned to the US I saw the Talenti product in my neighborhood supermarket. I quickly grabbed 3 containers and one of them was the Coconut & Almond I ‘be been hooked ever since. The coconut is creamy with hints of almonds, I felt as though I was in paradise. Simply the best of all the rest. Thank you for a quality product. Worth the price."

11_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,Good stuff. Smooth taste. Love it. Creme de la creme.
11_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"Ok... So Im new to this brand and I must say that I fell in love with this flavor. I havent had ice cream in so long, but the shopkick app had me scan these at target. Just my luck, they were 2 for $7. I purchased them and have been hooked ever since. I was looking to purchase again, but this time in Walmart, but they didnt have this flavor. I will keep checking. True fan indeed!!!"
11_talenti,5,6.0,2.0,"Im absolutely obsessed. This is the best thing Ive ever consumed. Im not paid by talenti or anything, Im honestly just obsessed. I had no idea what I was missing out on until now. My life is changed for the better."

11_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Im not a frequent gelato consumer, but when I am, I go straight for Talentis coconut almond chocolate flavor. It is the best. Period.

Mmmm mmmm"

The oat crisp layer was missing entirely, and the hot fudge layer and cookie layer was mostly on the outside edge of the package. I love this brand but I was so disappointed with the lack of elements. The sorbetto flavor was delicious, and the hot fudge was great and being vegan is a huge bonus. But I’d only tel people to buy with caution as this is the only flavor I’ve had this problem with."

Our new family favorite!!!!"
12_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"I have had many vegan ice creams ranging from Talenti, to oatly and others. And this one is my absolute favorite.

If you like coconut this will be your new favorite vegan ice cream. Found the product at Target."
12_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Coconut Chocolate Cookie, mmmm. This is the best gelato/ice cream/sorbet for me. I love it! The smooth texture and the flavorful taste.

12_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I recently had to go dairy free for health reasons, and the lack of satisfying ice cream has left me frustrated. Most brands use almond milk as a base for their vegan ice creams, but they dont sweeten it enough and just rely on whatever swirls and pieces are in it. This sorbetto was the opposite. It was delicious and just sweet enough, and it was so creamy I had to double check that it was actually dairy free."
12_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Am dairy free and have tried a handful of dairy free ice creams and this is by far the best. The layers are just the right amount of texture, seriously unmatched. Really hoping they come out with more non dairy layered flavors"
12_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,This was so good!! It says it is vegan on the packaging and confirmed with the ingredients list. For some reason the website does not list it under the vegan tab.

13_talenti,4,2.0,0.0,"I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and Im so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time."

13_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in todays coffee addicted world thats strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talentis Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!"
13_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. Thats where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time."
13_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.
13_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless its loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-Ill-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D"
13_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. Its the best coffee flavor Ive ever tasted. Its bolder than any other coffee flavored brands Ive tried so far. Normally I dont like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so its not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti."
13_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This gelato is creamy and oh-so delicious! Upon opening the lid, you can smell the yummy coffee scent so if you LOVE coffee like me, this was a pleasant aroma. This gelato has one of THE most true-to-coffee-flavor around. The chocolate chips were a nice compliment to the coffee flavor. Ill definitely be getting this again. Please note that I received this product free for testing."

13_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"So smooth, delicious and the right amount of that coffee splash with chocolate chip chunks! This is my first and the start of my love affair with Talenti Gelato!"
13_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I like the flavor, but I was expecting more of a coffee taste without the cream and sugar. Chocolate chips couldve been a bit bigger. I ended up grinding up chocolate covered espresso beans and adding it to the mix. More coffee and less sweet tasting. If you are someone who likes cream and sugar in your coffee its the flavor for you."
13_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The bessssst gelato I have tried (besides actually in Italy), but its soft just like Italy! I would totally recommend this product! Best taste ever, especially if you like coffee. The little chips are so great, I love have the little crunch you can say."
13_talenti,1,3.0,2.0,The after taste is strong and not pleasant. The coffee taste is bitter and the cream tastes like cheese. Big dissapointment.

15_talenti,5,12.0,2.0,Omg!! How is this dairy free?! It tastes like the real thing! I cant tolerate dairy products much because I can tell body doesnt approve but I usually succumb to cravings anyways. now I wont have to feel guilty for putting my body through lactose intolerance effects! I am a coffee lover and this right here HIT THE SPOT!!! Its rich and smooth and oh so creamy! The best non-dairy product yet! I finished half the pint in one sitting. Def over the serving size lol. Def telling my friends about this and if you love coffee then you have to try it out!!!!
15_talenti,5,14.0,0.0,"I have recently discovered that eating dairy really does not make my body happy. This is unfortunate because I love me some ice cream. I discovered this Cold Brew Coffee sorbetto in a grocery store a few towns over. So, I tried it. OH MY WORD it is so smooth, so rich, and SO delicious. Cold Brew coffee is one of my favorite things, so that helps. The flavor is ON POINT. I honestly could eat this every single night and be as happy as a clam. Ive told all my friends about it. This is the best non-dairy ice cream treat I have ever tried, and Ive tried most of them. 100% recommend to anyone I know."

I like it better than a lot of actual ice creams I’ve tried. I have been converted to a sorbetto lover! I received this product free for testing from Influenster."
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I bought this from meijer because I have seen online that it’s a very good brand. It was not really cheap for the amount you get but this is definitely some of the best “ice cream” I have ever had and I definitely believe it’s worth the price. I can’t wait to try the flavors. And eat 10 more pints of this lol.
15_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,How did this get sooo creamy? I would swear there was dairy in this sorbet. The texture is so smooth and the ice crystals nice and small. You will feel like a little kid eating something that is more what a responsible adult would eat. It is like my favorite coffee with just the right amount of sweet and cream has be magically spun by Elsa the ice princess herself to make this mom happy. Bravo Talenti! Now I am thinking of what liquor to add to it to make it a boozy mommy float.... I did receive this product free for testing and am ready to go snag another!
15_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"Having tried many of the delicious dairy and non dairy flavors, my new lady friend and I came across the cold brew coffee during a trip to CostCo. She informed me that we could share it, but coffee flavored IS her favorite (as well as mine) after staring at the pint in the freezer for about six weeks, she recently went to a weekend music festival, and the urge got the better if me.I just couldnt put it down, and consumed the entire container, assuming it would be easily replaced. Well, Im now having a dilemma locating this amazingly delicious flavor. So good, youll get in trouble for it!"
15_talenti,5,28.0,2.0,The absolute must for coffee lovers! Hard to believe it is sorbet. I am dairy and gluten free and this as well as the peanut butter fudge are an absolute treat!!!
15_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"Listen here everyone. This is the absolute BEST dairy free sorbetto that exists. My heart was broken when I found out I was lactose intolerant, but this Cold Brew Coffee Talenti has been there for me ever since- in good times or bad, I grab myself a pint of this stuff and that’s all I need. I’m sitting here eating it at this very moment and I’m not over-exaggerating I came to this website to see if there are more dairy free flavors to become addicted to in the same way. Unfortunately there are not many, so I just want to say... Talenti, you do it best. The ABSOLUTE best. Thank you. And if you can make more dairy-free flavors there will hardly be a day that goes by without pints of your heavenly dairy-free sorbetto in my freezer. My heart is forever yours."
15_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"A coffee lovers dream. And very dangerous. It’s so creamy... I literally can’t get over how creamy it is!! If you love coffee ice cream you’re gonna love this dairy free sorbetto. It’s on the tad sweet side but I love that is actually sweetened with real sugar — I hate the fake stuff. Contains only nine ingredients. However, if you have a nut allergy you might wanna watch out, it contains almonds. Also I’m not proud of it, but I ate half the container in five minutes and got a brain freeze... It’s dairy free and gluten-free and probably one of the best coffee things I’ve tasted. My only gripe... we only received one coupon for the taste test, I feel like we should have been able up sample more than just one to make an informed decision. Also, my local supermarkets did not have the flavor I really wanted to try, Almond Butter Honey. I received this product for free for testing from Influenster."
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Cold Brew Coffee Sorbetto is are most favorite cold treat around!! There is nothing that can beat it not even regular ice cream. This is super smooth and the perfect coffee taste. I know we aren’t the only ones who live it because it sells out so fast in all our local stores!! They can’t keep it on the freezer shelf. Please bring chocolate back so we can try it!!
15_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,Thanks to Influenster I got to try this sorbetto for FREE for my honest review.... its amazing!! So creamy. Not overly sweet.
15_talenti,5,8.0,1.0,"Your Cold Brew Coffee Sorbetto is the best. The taste is rich and creamy with a real coffee flavor not a flavor extract. The texture is smooth-who needs dairy! All the joy and none of the bloat and pain of ice cream. Best product ever! Be it dairy free or lactose free. You have found the secret and with only 10 ingredients,all of which I can pronounce . Good job!!!"
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is amazing! I love that it’s dairy free, so you don’t feel bloated or have a tummy ache after eating it! It’s perfect for coffee lovers and I can’t wait to try the other flavors. I’m so glad I gave it a chance it is definitely worth it!"
15_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"As someone who cant eat dairy, but doesnt always want a fruity icey flavor, this is such an exciting find! Im over the moon! The egg, I believe, gives it a smooth, almost creamy, mouthfeel that is very close to what is always missing from dairyfree desserts - even the ones made from soy or nuts. Please please please consider making more flavors with this method! I especially love non-chocolate, vanilla based flavors (plain vanilla, creme brulee, caramel, etc) if I can be so bold as to be particular ;) Thank you!!!"
15_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"to FINALLY find a milk free sorbetto that is so very very delicious! It pleases me on several counts,least of which is the real coffee taste. I have had a long love affair with quality ice cream and have been soooooo disappointed that I am now lactos intolerant. I have had clandestine affairs but always paid a price for my indiscriminate culinary adventures. I am so pleased to have discovered Talenti. Thank you so much!"
15_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"It is omg amazing! My favorite thing to eat for desert. I eat dairy all the time, I would never in a million years guess this was dairy free. I gave a pint to my friend with IBS for Christmas! She loved it and had no ill effects. She is also lactose Intolerant. I shared it with my friend because eating Cold Brew Coffee Sorbetto is like having a party in my mouth!! I wanted her to have so much happiness from eating too."
15_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,OMG this is so yummy! I am lactose-intolerant and I used to could take the Lactaid pills and still eat ice cream but even Lactaid pills doesnt help anymore so I had written ice cream out of my diet for a while until a friend had told me about this! It is awesome... it will be a regular thing for me now. I have had the raspberry sorbet one and it was pretty good but I love the creamy texture of this coffee cold brew
15_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"I love Talenti products and although I have my few favorites, I would say that just about all of the flavors are excellent quality and taste like what youd expect them to taste like. The Cold Brew is now right up there at the top of my list. Its much creamier than youd expect from a sorbetto but Im assuming that comes from the egg in it. I know that has made the vegans unhappy but the majority of coffee lovers will think this flavor is divine."
15_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Ive tried (and loved) other Talenti products. They fit the bill, because Im not a fan of non-dairy frozen desserts. You can keep your ice pops and whatnot...theyre not for me. I want something creamy, delicious, decadent. My husband found this. (Note: Its never a good idea to send your husband to the store. You end up with chocolate-covered sewing needles and spray paint in colors not found in nature. But I digress). I have been trying to eat healthier, and have thus incorporated coconut oil into my diet, to the point where Im sick of it. Everything made with it tastes of coconut, so I was mildly saddened to see that on the ingredients list. I am telling you, this does not taste like coconut...but of delicious coffee. To add to the ""dont like it"" list, Im also not a fan of sweet coffee. THIS, however, is perfect.. Not to sweet, rich. Im a fan and am buying it often."
15_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I found this at the local Walmart looking for dairy and lactose free icecream, Im lactose intolerant but icecream is my weakness. After getting sick eating regular icecream I decided to find an alternative, leading me to Talenti. The cold brew coffee is so good and the texture is smooth and creamy. I cant believe how simple the ingredients are with that flavorful taste. I love it 10/10 recommend!"
15_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,Its like cold brew that i mightve left in the freezer! It was absolutely delicious. With no guilt i ate the entire jar in one go! Life hack: put the lid under running water for a few seconds to remove it!! Thank you @influenster for letting me get to try this for free! #influenster #talenti
15_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I liked this flavor but didnt love it. I wish it were a bit less sweet & had a stronger coffee taste. The texture is remarkably creamy, especially conaidering since it has no milk or cream. If you cant have dairy, its terrific. But since I love that coffee with cream taste, Ill stick to regular coffee ice cream from now on."
15_talenti,1,4.0,2.0,"Overly sweet, not a strong coffee taste. Disappointing!"
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Bad part is can’t ever find it ,all the stores just carry the layers !! Would be nice if you could buy it by the gallon as well !!! Coupons would be nice to I buy 8 at a time when I find it 40 dollars for that little of you get why I don’t buy it everyday as well"
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the best dairy-free ice cream Ive had. And frankly I shouldnt have been surprised. Why trust random milk alternatives, when you can get creamy goodness from the perfect food: EGGS! I love it and will definitely be buying it again."
15_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"I love coffee but sometimes flavored coffee things don’t taste good. This ice cream is delicious, has a smooth rich flavor and it’s not bitter or anything. I will be buying this again! I received this product free for testing."
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This was my first time trying Talenti Dairy Free Sorbetto. The Cold Brew Coffee is delicious. It is so creamy, I had to look at the ingredients list to make sure there wasnt cream in it!"
15_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Outstanding product. So so very flavorful. Need my wife to not allow me to eat the whole container at one setting.
16_talenti,1,3.0,2.0,"When I first tried the dark chocolate cherry it was my favourite. I got another, last night, and sought out the cherry layer. There wasn’t one. In fact, there wasn’t a chocolate chunk layer, either! It was just chocolate gelato the whole way down until you got to the bottom truffle layer! They swirled the outside of the tub to make it look like it had layers, but it was just solid chocolate gelato all the way down! So disappointed! Thanks for reaching out. We apologize for your experience. Please feel free to contact us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com so that we can learn more."
16_talenti,3,18.0,1.0,The chocolate parts were delicious as always! But I was disappointed in the cherry layer. It tasted very fake. I was expecting to actually have some cherries in the layer and it was just a sauce.
16_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,Double Dark Chocolate was MIA. We’ve seen each other twice So it’s safe to say Dark Chocolate Cherry is my new BAE.
16_talenti,5,10.0,0.0,It has layers of flavor with real cherries and all natural flavors. The cherry is the best with chocolate. Talenti seriously has the best flavors always!!
16_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,These are just a few that are left over. Need 2 go & get some more.
16_talenti,5,12.0,1.0,"Ive been to Italy twice and each time I traveled, I would try a different flavor of gelato almost every evening. My favorite was in Venice; it was Dark Chocolate Rum Cherry. Absolutely this Talenti flavor is just as delicious as my memory of the other."
16_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,Oh my yummm this hit all of the right spots Love love the chocolate pieces crunch the smooth velvety decadent chocolate cream oh the Cherries amazzzing a lil tart perfect If chocolate is a weakness and you’re on a diet then you’re in trouble
16_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"Tried one of your new layers, dark chocolate cherry. Excellent!! I didn’t think I would find another flavor I liked like your double dark chocolate, but this comes in real close. Thank you"
16_talenti,5,18.0,6.0,"This is the only brand ice cream and gelato I buy. Every night I have two scoop paired with two small chocolate chips cookie. The price value of the product I think is under rated and should be higher. They make for great items to bring to a dinner party! This new flavor is full of deep, dark chocolate and the layers completely compliment each other."
16_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This was one of the best created gelato I have had in a long time. It put many three of my favorite things together in one bite - Yum
16_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,The layering of flavor is fantastic. Every bite has a multitude of flavors. Best gelato ever.
16_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"In all my years, decades on this planet, have I ever had such an incredible treat."
16_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,This product was so good! Love the tart cherry note and how well it went with the diffrent chocolate layers.
16_talenti,3,3.0,1.0,"I really wanted to love this. Chocolate and cherry is my favorite flavor combination. I went to multiple stores just to get this flavor. The gelato is fabulous as you would expect. However, the layering is a total FAIL for me. You cannot easily get all of the pieces in a bite. I pretty much made a gigantic mess trying to burrow in just to get to layer two so I could at least get some cherry with my chocolate. Perhaps if you had multiple people and were going to eat the entire container in one sitting, the you could remove it first to allow everyone to get all of the flavors. The layers are pretty, but just not practical. If it were possible to insert the layers vertically, it would work well. But as that is likely not an easy feat, it really should be a higher number of thinner layers. Otherwise you are just eating a layer at a time with an occasional mixing as you move to the next layer. Also, the cherry layer in the container I had was very uneven in thickness. The pieces on the bottom were great in flavor, but once again layered extremely unevenly... all on one side. And, it was more like just a random chunch piece at the end as opposed to a piece that fit well with a total composition. Im not sure if I would recommend spending the extra money for the Layers product over the standard, unless the layering was revamped. Maybe if you can get it on a good sale? Perhaps one of the other combos would work a little better. I have tried the cherry chocolate cheesecake two, but have the same issue with the layering. It was a good idea, but as currently produced is probably not the product for me. :( Were sorry to hear you were disappointed with our Dark Chocolate Cherry Layers Gelato!

17_talenti,5,27.0,0.0,"I have been severely allergic to dairy all of my life, no dairy free ice cream or sorbet ever came close to real creamy sorbet/ice cream until now. This is amazing!!! Simply full of flavor and so rich and delicious. Im a holistic nutritionist and for those who are vegan please keep in mind that being vegan is a choice not a serious allergy issue and eggs are not dairy. They come from a chicken they are not dairy. So dont ruin it for those of us dairy sufferers by writing bad reviews on items that have eggs. When you do this it hurts those of us who are allergic to dairy when the product isnt made anymore. In case you havent realized it, there are more products for gluten free and vegan than dairy free. Leave us this wonderful product!!!!!"
17_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"I bought this thinking it was regular gelato, then saw it was dairy-free and was expecting it to not taste good. I have to say, I think it’s better than before. And yes, it’s made with eggs for the people who think that’s absurd, even though eggs are a main ingredients in ice cream, so it’s not that far fetched that they’re a gelato. It’s delicious, and it’s a great way to cut dairy. Obviously not pleasing to the vegans, but a win for most everyone else!"
17_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"For a dairy-free alternative frozen dessert, this is amazing. It taste wonderful.. like eating a chocolate bar. This product is a wonderful buy. My daughter loves it! Nothing on the package was misleading, it does NOT say it’s vegan. Just DAIRY-FREE. So for the low reviews with people that don’t read the ingredient list, please ignore them. Great buy."
17_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,Thank you so much for the dairy free options! My son needs dairy free for a milk protein allergy and loves your sorbet. We always do the raspberry dairy free but recently tried the chocolate dairy free one and he was so excited to have this. This really tastes like chocolate ice cream and it’s amazing!! It totally made his day!!! Thank you!!!
17_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"This dairy free ice cream is amazing. For those of us who cannot have dairy but are NOT vegan this is such a great product. Its obvious that the egg yolks and whites add something good. Amazing flavor and texture. Its the first dairy free ice cream that actually tastes like real ice cream, not an alternative."
17_talenti,5,14.0,5.0,"I was browsing the ice cream section when I decided this product looked interesting. Tried this with my family and it is so good! It tastes like a good quality chocolate flavor, not that fake cocoa powder taste. Would definitely pick up again."
17_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,So happy to find an option for my daughter and I who are both dairy free that actually feels like a real chocolate treat. Great texture and flavor. I wouldn’t change a thing and buy this regularly. Love it.
17_talenti,5,10.0,5.0,"I just discovered this new flavor by mistake and now am having trouble finding more (Spring Hil TN)!!! The Gelatos and this particular Dark Choco Sorbetto are THE BEST !!!!!!!! Need to convince Walmart, Publix and Kroger in our area to stock up !!!"
17_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,This is the best diary free ice cream ever but I’m not pregnant and I don’t know if it’s safe to eat because of the chocolate Liquor.
17_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"Love the chocolate flavor, and I can taste a hint of a nutty flavor as well which makes it even better! So creamy and sweet!"
18_talenti,5,29.0,4.0,"Yum... new name for this should be...Death by Chocolate! A pint is the perfect size. The gelato comes in a nice plastic container. I save the containers for change candy or ect. I wish there was a retail shop, where you can refill these containers with our favorite. Or if you can do it with a sticker label instead of the engravings. Thanks."
18_talenti,5,10.0,1.0,This is such an amazing flavor and possibly the best tasting gelato I have ever had! I am truest addicted to this and can not get enough its so rich and creamy especially when the sides of the container melt a little it really brings out its full flavor. Then you get little crunches of chocolate chips that compliment its already amazing flavor!
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"If I want just straight up chocolate with delectable morsals..This is my go to. I usually eat the vanilla 5 flavor, but I do adore this flavor.. bring on the deliciousness"
18_talenti,5,8.0,2.0,My guilty pleasure and absolute FAVORITE chocolate flavor. I love the texture that the chocolate chips bring. I can easily eat a whole pint if I really wanted to ;)
18_talenti,5,8.0,3.0,I am just a normal teen girl who just loves average sweets and everything chocolatey. I had this few months ago after I tasted the Coffee and the Caramel flavor. This brand is something that I trust out of America; no schemes. no phony tactics. The chocolate chips leave some delightful crunches
18_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,Im a big fan of anything Italian including gelato and sorbetto. Talenti does a great justice to the craft. This Double Dark Chocolate is a fine example of their skill! I wont hesitate on future purchases of any Talenti product. Real ingredients from a company who cares about their reputation of offering a fantasticly delicious gelato!
18_talenti,5,6.0,2.0,"I curse the day I decided to treat myself to an upscale frozen treat after a break-up. I cant stop buying Talenti which posses a problem, because I still need to take my cats in for their check-up. I wish the Jewel in Wauconda, IL carried the entire Talenti flavors."
18_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,There is only one store in my country (Suriname) that carries your brand. Unfortunatly they dont carry all the flavors. Just finished my double dark chocolate. I dont waste my calories on any other gelato or ice cream for me....i only indulge in talenti
18_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,I don’t enjoy the chunks. I would like a richer dark chocolate flavor 70% cacao is best. Not as silky as sea salt caramel. Had an abnormal after taste. Didn’t satisfy my craving and regret the calories.
18_talenti,1,4.0,3.0,I have been to Europe and had dark chocolate gelato there. This is neither dark chocolate nor gelato. This is overpriced chocolate ice cream. It does not have the richness or texture of real gelato. Im not sure why but I have not found a US ice cream brand that has made anything comparable to real European gelato. Disappointing.
18_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"This intense chocolate gelato is almost perfect. Perfect except for those pieces of dark chocolate. Biting down on a hard surface when expecting a smooth experience takes away from total enjoyment of this wonderful gelato. Not all gelatos need pieces of things included, and this is one of them."
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This stuff makes me sing! I find myself humming and swaying in my seat like a little kid when I eat it. I wish the stores in my area carried more flavors. I haven’t found the chocolate anywhere and that’s my fave flavor. And The sorbet is so good it makes your insides smile.
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Since I have discovered Talenti I dont buy any other brand. No chemicals, no junk. Just wish more places carried the quart size! When I was in Italy I had Gelato for lunch every day. This tastes the same!"
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Soothes the chocolate craving with just a few scoops! So smooth & creamy with just the right amount of chocolate chunks. My freezer is never without it!
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I tried the Double Dark Chocolate Gelato for the first time and was blown away by the texture and flavor. It now has become my favorite dessert.
18_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,If you love dark chocolate then you will LOVE this flavor. This is my go-to flavor of Talenti. Its hard to stop eating once you start.
18_talenti,2,2.0,1.0,"This is the first time I’ve had gelato and really it’s not all it’s hyped up to be, it’s overly sweet and has a very icy texture"
18_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,Absolutely delicious ice cream. You can tell the chocolate chips arent ordinary. Thick and creamy!

19_talenti,5,12.0,1.0,This is the ONLY icecrem I eat meaning the Fudge Brownie is ALL that I eat! I eat it everynight before bed lol! But Im very disappointed because where I live Inlges discontinued the Fudge Brownie and now I see that Food Lion has it on closeout(which they was the cheapest) so BI-LO is the only place I will be able to get it! I better not see them go on closeout! Why are they doing this???
19_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"This gelato is definitely in the top 5 of Talenti flavors. It is creamy, tasty, and oh so chocolaty! The chunks of brownie was so good, wish there were more chunks though. Fudge Brownie satisfied my chocolate cravings unlike Talentis Double Dark Chocolate gelato. My sister is a chocolate fanatic, she tried some of mines and she loved the Fudge Brownie gelato as well."
19_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"I have seriously never searched for an ice cream/gelato brand for the sole purpose to give it a 5/5 review. This was simply amazing and hands out the best ice cream I have ever tried. Its so smooth and creamy, but there is something inexplicably addicting to the texture and taste. The fudge chunks are rich. Love it! Will try other flavors."
19_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,"I was an ice cream girl until I discovered this at a local market. Talenti Fudge Brownie Gelato is the best chocolate frozen treat Ive ever tasted in my 70+ years. For some reason, the last few times I looked for it, none of the stores in my area are stocking it. PLEASE encourage all vendors to carry this amazingly wonderful treat."
19_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"Im not a huge ice cream fan and could really care less about it. My husband brought home this chocolate brownie fudge for himself.

19_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"After trying the chocolate chip cookie (my usual go-to for any cream brand), I was a little let down by the flavor and texture. So on a whim I tried this one instead. Best decision. Soft, batter-like brownie chunks. Creamy chocolate taste. Will be buying again."

20_talenti,1,4.0,2.0,The first time I had this flavor it was great. The second time there was a ton of hazelnut skin in the container. Photos arent even from the whole container. Just what Ive tried to eat so far. Had to trash the rest. This is so strange! Please send us an email so we can make this right for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us PS: it would be great if you could keep the container for the batch info on the bottom so we can follow up with our hazelnut supplier!
20_talenti,1,5.0,3.0,Talenti must have run out of chocolate because there were absolutely NO chocolate chips in my pint. Were sorry to hear that your Hazelnut gelato was missing the delicious chocolate chips! If you reach out to our customer service team they can help you out! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us
20_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,"I grew up in Germany spending my summers in Italy eating Gelato. My favorite was always Nociole = Hazelnut which was always an available flavor in every Gelateria. Hard to find good Gelato here in the USA. My husband is half Italian and also loves Talenti Hazelnut. Talenti is my favorite Gelato since I moved to the US and Hazelnut Chocolate Chips is my all time favorite flavor. Please Talenti, always make this flavor. However, it is not always easy to find in stores. Sometimes I can find it at our local Vons or Target and I get depressed when I can not buy it......!"
20_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,If you are someone who loves hazelnut and chocolate combo then this is your flavor! its so amazing and delicious. Its so delicious that I almost ate the whole jar in one sitting. Dont you hate it when you have to go fishing for the nuts? Well with this you dont have to because talenti is very generous with the amount of hazelnuts and chocolate chip. I hope they will keep this as one of their permanent flavor and bring it to BJs and Costco!!!!!! this small tub of gelato is never enough =P
20_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,I cant believe how delicious this is...Im seriously sad thinking about all the time Ive wasted eating other brands of ice cream... no more ice cream for this woman. Talenti Gelato is now right up there with milk and coffee on my shopping list...a must have in my freezer. And it might just always be the hazelnut choc. chip. Its amazing.....okay..enough reviewing...I have to get to the store before it closes......

20_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,I loved it me and my daughter i recommend gallons instead of pints
20_talenti,5,4.0,2.0,This Hazelnut Chocolate Chip gelato is simply amazing! So delicate and packed full of hazelnuts. I cant wait to try other flavors!
20_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I love Talenti AND also I love hazelnut. Where was the love in this ice cream? Vaguely a hazelnut flavor, though it was stuffed with the skins of hazelnuts, making for an unpleasant taste and very, very few chocolate chips. An expensive misfire."
20_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I am a fan of hazelnut products. This was bland, dull. I didnt want to finish the container. The only fun was the crunchy bits. I do not recommend this flavor. Try salted caramel."
20_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Not my favorite out of the bunch. It has way to many chips. The crunchy texture is overwhelming and make it hard to enjoy.
21_talenti,5,8.0,0.0,"I didnt think Id ever be able to pick a favorite flavor or Talenti, until today! Key Lime Pie is amazingly refreshing and has sweet bites of graham crust mixed in that taste like tiny cookies! Yum, are you kidding me... heaven on earth in my freezer right now! I dont even have plasticware for packing lunches like a normal person, I upcycle the Talenti jars. Looks like Ill have quite a few with Key Lime on the label now. Move over black raspberry chocolate chip!"
21_talenti,5,23.0,4.0,"Never have I ever done a review f any kind, but it merits one.This is my 1st time to try gelato of your brand, only the 4th time to ever eat any gelato and all I can say is it was perfect! Definitely key lime like taste-tangy and creamy at the same time. The Graham cracker crust was also perfect! Just the right size chunks! I ate the whole pint in 1sitting straight from the jar! While eating the gelato, I imagined myself of royalty and elegance! ( I have NEVER described food of any kind that way before either and Im 61 years old). I will definitely be trying different kinds each time I go should shopping. Cant think of anything to change- and- also love the jar. Thank you for making it just perfect!"
21_talenti,2,44.0,15.0,"I was so excited to see a key lime flavored ice cream among Talentis other incredible flavors! Unfortunately, the tangy key lime flavor I was hoping for just wasnt there. This is a very mild flavored ice cream with barely a hint of lime, but the graham crust is actually very good. Do not buy this if you are looking for the signature tangy key lime pie flavor you are probably more familiar with. Its still a tasty treat, just misleading and disappointing if you are looking for a true key lime pie flavor. This will not keep me from trying more new flavors!"
21_talenti,5,10.0,3.0,"This gelato is fantastic. Another reviewer described it as ""elegant"" and that is precisely how I would describe it. The flavor is incredible and very close to the custard key lime pie that my family makes. I think the negative reviews are coming from people who either are used to artificial citrus flavorings and/or people who are expecting a sorbetto as opposed to a gelato. It is creamy becuase it is infact a GELATO. Obviously. I love it. I can rarely find it so when I do, I buy all of them and keep them on hand. Perfect for an elegant dessert to serve to unexpected guests."
21_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,"If you are not a fan of Key Lime Pie, stop reading now. If you DO love this tasty tart bliss...dont walk - run to the nearest Talenti freezer and stock up! The pie is but a memory since discovering this pint of heaven. A light, creamy, lime goodness, mixed with a perfect amount of crumbly Graham crust. The only thing that could make this better, in my book, is a more pronounced presence of Key limes. Its divine - quarts, half gallons... please!"
21_talenti,5,11.0,1.0,"Ive just tasted the Key Lime Pie gelato and I adore it. Im not one for very tart or overpowering flavors so was reluctant to try this one. But the subtle lime flavored gelato and soft graham cracker bits laced within it, each elegantly holds its own identity, yet blend together magnificently. The smooth texture is sublime as well."
21_talenti,2,15.0,10.0,I love Talenti. Huge fan. I love Key Lime Pie. Perhaps my favorite pie. I was really excited to see the flavor. It tastes great. It tastes like really nice vanilla gelato with some graham cracker chunks. It just has no real Key Lime flavor of any sort. I get subtlety and Im all for it. But this is beyond subtle. Its like the guy whos one job it was to put in the Key Lime flavor was home sick the day they made this batch(I hope hes feeling better). Talenti as a brand is wonderful. I just dont get this one.
21_talenti,2,20.0,8.0,"Talenti has become my favorite brand for gelato, and so far Ive enjoyed every flavor, except this one. I was in the mood for a flavor with a sharp bite to it, and lime seemed to fit the bill. However, when I took my first taste, I could only find the smallest hit of lime flavor. I looked on the ingredients list, and there is no mention of lime at all. I could only assume that ""natural flavoring"" was meant to be lime, which was far down on the ingredients list. Sans lime, the flavor of this gelato is heavy on the cream and coconut (which, personally, Im not used to coconut in key lime pie either) with no sharp citrus bite I was hoping for, only creamy with the warmth of the coconut. Without taking into consideration what this particular flavor is called, is good in its own right. In my opinion though, a lot more lime flavoring should be added, or the name changed to ""Coconut Cream Pie""."
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Im a huge fan of key lime pie and I search out anything key lime pie flavored. While this would have probably garnered a good review from me on its own, the chunks of Graham cracker that taste like pie crust is what sealed the 5-star review. I love, love, loved this."
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I had to let others know about this flavor! I am not a huge ice cream fan, but this one in my new addiction! It takes like eating a creamy pie. The key lime is not as tangy as I was expecting but the overall taste is extraordinary. Ive had gelato in Italy and usually stick to the fruit varieties, this one is a wonderfully special deviation from the normal fruits! TRY THIS! If you like cream pie, youll love this one! I do taste the hint of coconut so it mimics coconut cream pie to me with the touch of acidic to bring in the key lime taste. Enjoy!"
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is a lovely subtle key lime pie flavor with tasty graham bits :)! Happily I found this in a store nearby and it shares my freezer with my favorite FroYo. I was able to turn my dad onto it and he loved it, probably would have eaten a whole pint himself if polite manners didnt intervene. I went online to find that Talenti gelato is offered in multiple locations by his home in another state and emailed him a list of stores. Unfortunately none of the stores by him had Key Lime Pie but Im sure he can find at least ONE other flavor to enjoy."
21_talenti,1,3.0,2.0,"I purchased this product in hopes that it would capture the essence of a true key lime pie, but was let down. I love the Talenti brand, however this flavor is a miss. When I first tasted the product, I thought that the key lime ""flavor"" was very faint and wondered if it was my imagination and there was no flavor at all. This prompted me to look at the ingredients list ---- no key lime or key lime flavor. Talenti if you wish to market a product with a specific flavor, please actually add that flavor to the product."
21_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,Cant find it in Miami..in Publix only once! Same basic flavors all of the time. Need to keep a better stock
21_talenti,1,2.0,1.0,"have any of you ever actually HAD Key Lime Pie?!??!? there wasnt even the slightest HINT of lime in this product, much less anything that could be called Key Lime. My father grew up in Miami and used to gather real key limes in the Keys. We both absolutely LOVE Key Lime anything, so I was extremely disappointed when I tried this gelato. Considering how much your product costs per ounce, I doubt seriously Ill ever spend that much again to try any of your other flavors."
21_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this gelato. I dont even like any other flavor gelato or ice cream anymore. If I cant have my Telenti Key Lime Pie, then I want nothing at all. I dont even like traditional key lime pie anymore. This is by far the most delicious, wonderfully made frozen treat on the market."
21_talenti,1,4.0,3.0,"Key lime gelato is my favorite (Ciao Bella used to make a great one) so I was thrilled to find this today. Unfortunately, it has no lime flavor. I checked the ingredient list and there is no lime in this product, none. All I taste is vanilla and cinnamon. Very disappointed. Your Mango gelato, however, is excellent."
21_talenti,3,2.0,1.0,My first talenti key lime pie. Very yummy but it does not taste like key lime at all and Im a Florida girl! I taste coconut and graham cracker (still yummy) I might have a slight key lime taste in my mouth as an aftertaste but Id be interested in a little more key lime in this key lime pie pint

21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is my favorite flavor of Talenti....so imagine my disappointment now that I cant find it in any stores. Please bring it back. Its amazing flavor. I just knew that it would be back for summer but Id love it to be a permanent flavor.
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"These reviews saying it doesnt taste like key lime pie are somewhat true, but if you throw away your expectations, youll realize that is the best icecream ever created. Try it for yourself. It is pricy, but its totally worth it"
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This gelato has changed my whole gelato experience. I love the subtle key lime flavor with bits of pie crust. I am sad that I am unable to find it in my area. Please do not change anything about this ice cream. It is my favorite.
21_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Hands down my favorite. If you enjoy the texture of the pie crust and the tart key lime this is just the best. Help I can’t find it anywhere anymore.

22_talenti,4,4.0,0.0,"This is a great flavor, but the lemon gelato is sooooo amazing all by itself. Id love to see Talenti come out with a plain lemon gelato flavor without any of the pie/graham pieces and blueberry. For me, the extra stuff is unnecessary, and takes away from the pure simple delicious flavor of the lemon gelato"
22_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is my favorite, it’s the perfect lemony dessert it’s extremely difficult not to eat the entire pint all at once. I was fortunate enough to find this flavor at Target , although they only had just this one pint and I have not been able to find it again in my area . It would be tragic if I’m not able to find it again. Thanks for your feedback! Were glad that you find this flavor as delicious as we do, though were sorry that youve had difficulty finding it.

23_talenti,1,3.0,0.0,This was my favorite flavor ever! But for some reason the past few months it suddenly changed. It used to have actual vanilla bean flakes in it but now every store I go to they are just white. Without the vanilla bean flakes it doesn’t have much flavor. I tried to reach out to Talenti because I thought it was just a messed up batch. They sent Me a coupon and said that it is supposed to have flakes it in but I still can’t find one anywhere that has them. Thanks for your review on Talenti Gelato Vanilla Bean Pint! Our team is sorry to hear about your experience with our gelato. We would like to hear more about your feedback. Please feel free to reach us at consumer.services@unilever.com. We look forward to hearing from you!
23_talenti,1,84.0,19.0,"I used to love this flavor and it was my favorite vanilla flavor of all time. Then I went to buy it as I do purchase it quite often and noticed that ""Tahitian"" had been dropped from the name. Immediately I thought ""please dont let this be a recipe change"". Sure enough I tasted it when I got home and it doesnt taste at all the same as the previous version. The formula was PERFECT before and now its mild, boring and indistinguishable from every other run of the mill vanilla flavored ice cream & gelato that already occupy space in the market. Bring the original back!!!! I will not repurchase this."
23_talenti,3,21.0,1.0,"The Vanilla Bean flavor, only recently available, seems more bland than before. Tahitian Vanilla Bean has always been my favorite Talenti flavor, and since I love almost all the flavors, thats saying something! For friends who think vanilla is just ""plain vanilla"", I give them a taste of Tahitian Vanilla Bean, so they know what a great vanilla frozen dessert should actually taste like. They become instant fans! Please dont change! I wouldnt know what to do without the private trip to Tahiti for my taste buds."
23_talenti,1,13.0,3.0,"Vanilla Bean was my favorite ice cream. Madagascan Vanilla Bean is disgustingly syrupy and I would never buy it again. It says its recipe#2 but the vanilla beans are omitted from the new version, so its not the same recipe. I found a stash of older ones at a drug store. Compare ingredients in the photo"
23_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,"I decided to finally try talenti out and this flavor caught my eye and Im glad it did because it is amazing , so creamy and delicious.."
23_talenti,1,31.0,5.0,"Yesterday had a spoon of my favorite flavor -- and it was no longer my favorite flavor!! Instead it was much milder. Thats when I noticed the packaging only said ""Vanilla bean"", dropping the ""Tahitian"" -- They changed the recipe!! Three stores checked and only one original Tahitian found... please tell me its not my last."
23_talenti,1,20.0,2.0,"Im extremely upset that the Tahitian Vanilla Bean flavor has been discontinued. This plain, bland flavor of vanilla bean is nothing compared to the kick that Tahitian Vanilla had! It just tastes like cheap regular vanilla ice cream. I would not recommend spending so much on a pint of ice cream."
23_talenti,3,14.0,1.0,"I had a quart of the new vanilla and a quart of the tahitian vanilla right next to each other. There were two of us comparing them and both of us chose the tahitian - absolutely. The tahitian was a little darker and had a lot more bean. Please bring it back to the original!!! Were in the process of changing over to a sustainable vanilla bean from Madagascar. It will be the same recipe but a bean that we feel better about using in our products. Taste and quality are our top priority, and were committed to bringing you the best tasting vanilla in our gelatos! PS: the darker color just has to do with the product age, the fresher gelato will be a bit lighter in color!"
23_talenti,1,9.0,0.0,"I found out about Talenti Tahitian Vanilla Bean ice cream when I moved back to San Francisco several years ago. It was my favorite gelato vanilla ice cream, even when compared to the many great gelato places in SF. When I moved to Chicago, I went to get my favorite jar of gelato, and all I saw was vanilla bean. I thought this might be a regional thing, maybe Tahitian Vanilla was only on the west or east coast. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought this Talenti Vanilla Bean imposter, and found that it wasnt nearly as satisfying as it had been. I hunted for Tahitian Vanilla Bean until I found out that Talenti no longer sells that flavor, and didnt even bother to put it in their retired section. I used to be able to eat just a couple scoops of the Tahitian Vanilla Bean and felt blissfully satisfied. This replacement had me eating half the jar before I felt the same level of satisfaction. While the recipe is similar to the old Tahitian Vanilla bean it just isnt the same. Tahitian Vanilla Bean was my one reason to buy Talenti, and now its gone."
23_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I buy Talenti Gelato Tahitian/Madagascan Vanilla BEAN allllllllll the time! The last few months I have struggled to find a product that is worth eating. The first time I got a bad one it was missing the beans. I started to pay more attention after that to make sure what I was grabbing would have the BEANS in my vanilla BEAN ice cream. I would have to hunt to the very back of the section to sometimes find one. The whole shelf would be full of beanless vanilla BEAN ice cream. Last couple times at MULTIPLE stores when im looking for a good one.. they are all GREEN! The bottom of the container is what looks like an old freezer burnt green color. ALSO WITH NO BEANS! I have been so irritated by this that Ive began to give up looking. At $4.99 a pint... I think would be best if you figured out what is going on with this ice cream and fixed it or you will lose a lot customers by this. Please fix your product!
23_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Ever since I first had Tahitian Vanilla bean I’ve been hooked but now that I’ve purchased Madagascan Vanilla bean I’m highly disappointed. It doesn’t taste like vanilla bean, it’s a light taste. As you continue to eat it it starts to lose flavor, the ingredients state that vanilla bean isn’t in it. I’m ashamed as a customer"

23_talenti,1,5.0,0.0,I LOVED Tahitian Vanilla Bean and am SO disappointed that I can no longer find it. I am not interested in spending this much money on ice cream/gelato/any desert if it is for a second rate vanilla that is far less superior to the original. BRING IT BACK!

23_talenti,1,3.0,0.0,"When I first tried this it was Tahitian Vanilla Bean and I was hooked. It had an amazing flavor and the texture was perfect! I was buying this every week. Now that the name and recipe has changed it is no longer the same. I have tried to like it but can get past the sticky texture, it no longer melts in your mouth and has lost its light natural taste. I will not buy this again unless it returns to the original recipe."
23_talenti,3,5.0,0.0,Kind of bland next to the Tahitian. I suggest you bring the Tahitian back because this is ordinary now.

23_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"I understand that the cost of vanilla beans has skyrocketed as of late so it might not be as economically viable to utilize the old recipe but it truly was so much better than the current one. As others have said, the new one is incredibly bland and offers no distinction from other vanillas out there. It will be my last vanilla purchase till the recipe changes again."

23_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"First time trying any of the Talenti vanilla flavors. This doesnt have much body, just kind of an uncomfortably thick, syrupy texture with minimal flavor. Wont be buying it again. I wonder if they changed the recipe to cut costs or because of supply issues?"

24_talenti,5,22.0,1.0,"Talenti Mediterranean Mint is my perfect feel-good snack or dessert. Talentis take on the mint flavoring process—using mint leaf extractives instead of peppermint/spearmint oil—is quite singular in the ice cream and gelato crafting world. It produces this rich, herbal flavor that, while a little less intense than other mint ice creams & gelati, is very calming and satisfying. Using the mint leafs for their product also supplies it with that natural verdant hue, avoiding the need to add any food coloring whatsoever to implement that easy-on-the-eyes creamy green pigmentation, which color adds to the relaxation (albeit on a more subtle, psychological level.) The smooth, creamy texture is easy to dig into, and the dark chocolate chunks are so minuscule that they are easy to bite into and chew (a lot of companies make ""mint chocolate chip"" with thick and/or round morsels that, due to the coldness, are very hard and thus difficult to bite into; small, thin chunks are much easier to nibble on, even when frozen), making this a very easy to enjoy treat. I would love it if I could purchase it in a larger size and not have to worry about buying it as often (and certainly save a few pennies in the process), but the current size of one pint is admittedly sufficient. As a complete aside, I would like to recommend making a flavor that is a combination or swirl of Mediterranean Mint & Tahitian Vanilla Bean, as that would be even more relaxing, even richer, and a good deal more creative than either of the two on its own."
24_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"I have always loved everything mint chocolate . This has long been my favorite Ice cream flavor and discovering this talenti Mediterranean Chocolate mint flavor has added JOY to my life . It is inexplicably delicious !

I buy mini cone cups and pretend that I will be satisfied with one yummy and adorable mini cone, layered with both flavors. I never have just one! I hope hope hope my Grocer will stock the peppermint chocolate chip this holiday PLEASE!!"

This gelato is a perfect creamy mint pick me up!

Needless to say fresh herbal mint doesnt taste like reproduction mint, it actually tastes like an earthy plant, as I think it should. This gelato tastes just like that mint leaf I ate one time and like, wow, thats some fresh mint! The chocolate is also very good!"
24_talenti,5,21.0,1.0,Hiii!! I just want to say that this is probably the best gelato in the whole world. I probably eat 1/2-a whole pint of this stuff whenever I have it. Its delicious and I highly recommend everyone buy this right now. Once you start you cant stop.

The dark chocolate pieces are my favorite part! They’re so rich and delicious. The mint to chocolate ratio is perfect. The actual texture of this gelato is nice, creamy and light. I wish it was maybe a tiny bit creamier on the tongue but it’s still really good. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review."
24_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,I was really hesitant on trying this flavor but it blew my mind away! It has the perfect amount of mint and the chocolate pieces make it a great combination! I would highly recommend getting Mediterranean Mint!
24_talenti,3,2.0,0.0,"I’m very disappointed in the changes to Mediterranean Mint. It’s been one of my top special favorites for years (along with Double Dark Chocolate). I had one pint saved in the freezer and recently bought two more on sale. I immediately noticed a change in the texture of the new MM which is now stiff, like putty or playdough. And there is a slight change in the ingredients. Also ‘old’ containers have ingredient list to the right of the nutrition chart and ‘new’ containers have ingredient list below the nutrition chart. The difference in texture between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ MM is obvious and sad to say I don’t enjoy the new sticky, pasty texture (makes it hard to pick out the chocolate chips ;-) However, the texture of Double Dark Chocolate (in ‘new’ containers) is the same as earlier (in ‘old’ containers) ... light and easy to eat ;-) So ... what can I say? ... except, I’ll only buy the MM if I see it has an ‘old’ ingredients label. As the saying goes, change doesn’t always mean improvement. Also, I’m not interested in any fancy new flavors ;-("
24_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"This used to be the BEST MINT treat in the WORLD. I used to buy like 5 jars and eat 1 a night it was SO good. It was ACTUALLY MINTY for once and thats hard to find. Then, within the past two months or so, I noticed it tasted totally different! The mint got WEAK. It tastes like.... water flavored cream. I tried it a few times to be sure i didnt get a bad batch or wasnt nuts but they did something. WHY DID YOU CHANGE THIS??!?!?!

24_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I bought this by accident; I meant to get the pistachio. But once I tried it, it became our go-to for Friday nights after dinner. I agree with most of the positive reviews of this product. The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because neither my husband nor I could open it! (No, we dont have arthritis.) My husband finally had to take it outside and open it with a garden tool! Other than that, best ice cream out there!"
24_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This flavor is DELICIOUS. I have had other Talenti flavors, but seriously none of them compare to this one. My only wish is that it wasnt so amazing, since I end up eating an entire pint in one sitting most of the time. But, seriously, please dont change a thing! The mint flavor is present but not overpowering, and the dark chocolate chips are not extremely sweet, which is my favorite type of dessert. :)"
24_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,I am a mint chip aficionado and this mint is hands down my favorite
24_talenti,3,3.0,1.0,Im pregnant and craving minty foods. I thought the flavor was going to be intense but to me the minty flavor is barely there. Kind of disappointing. My husband says its pretty good but Im just not tasting it.
24_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"Hey guys. I used to be the biggest Mediterranean Mint fan ever! Like it was the BEST! However, I noticed a flavor change with the packaging change. It makes me a little sad, because it doesnt taste as good anymore. However, I am not bashing Talenti. I have a lot of love for the company. Someone else may adore this flavor, its just not me anymore; hopefully I find a new favorite flavor :)"
24_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This gelato is soo delicious! It gives the the same great taste as ice cream( if u think ice cream is better than this) except it gives a more satisfying flavor and denser dessert absolutely love it! In general : they all come in RECYCLABLE CONTAINERS!!!
24_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is one of THE GOATS.Be very careful when you taste it for the first time..I can almost guarantee you’ll be addicted to this after your first taste...It’s an great addiction though..... I JUST LOVE GELATO MEDITERRANEAN MINT.
24_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I love this gelato so much! I eat it slow and when I came home to find my fiancé finished my pint I almost called off the wedding. The minty flavor is perfect and the chips really give the perfect texture mix. 
24_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"I always get this flavor because its the best. Unfortunately, my jar came with no chocolate chips. I thought it was a new thing not to add anything until I read the ingredients that it comes with them."
24_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Amazing texture and great taste! I ate this stuff every day almost and I just can’t get enough!! I only like the Mediterranean mint and all stores around me are sold out because of it!!

THE FUDGE AND HUGE COOKIE CRUNCH YUM. Better then my all time favorite of carvel with hot fudge and crunchies. I dont know how you crafted this but keep it up, so delicious."
25_talenti,5,22.0,0.0,Love it !!! Definitely will be regular item in my freezer :)))
25_talenti,5,13.0,0.0,This is like a hot fudge sundae with mint ice cream except it is on steroids. This flavor is the best chocolate mint combo I have ever had. Hard to find sometimes because it is soooo good. This is a home run idea idea with these layers. You cant get these flavors and quality from any other brand.
25_talenti,5,14.0,0.0,"This may be the best thing I have ever eaten! The mint gelato alone would be superb, but then you hit the cookie crunch and just when you think there’s no way it could get better,,, BOOM fudge. This stuff is AMAZING."
25_talenti,5,25.0,1.0,"I usually eat ice cream really slow. Ill eat a few bites and put it away for another day, but this pint was finished in a day!"

25_talenti,5,34.0,4.0,The textures are incredible! Went to culinary school in Italy and this is the closest you can get!
25_talenti,5,11.0,4.0,"I tried this Talenti Mint Fudge Cookie layered gelato for the first time today. It is absolutely phenomenal! Using a long teaspoon, I plunged into all of the decadent layers, bringing them all together in harmony on my spoon. The smoothness of the gelato and fudge mixed with the crunchy texture of the cookie was pleasing to the palate and the divine flavor combination took it to a whole new level. I highly recommend you try this. It will take you to a place of bliss."
25_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,This sweet treat had me wanting more! The cookie crumbles are chewy and chocolaty. The chocolate balances out the mint so perfectly! Can’t wait to try the others

25_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,Favorite flavor to date! Love everything about it! Just wish it had more cookie crumbs in the middle layer!
25_talenti,3,2.0,0.0,"The taste for this Mint Fudge Cookie is great. Love the Mint Ice Cream. Love the Fudge. And Love the Cookie. My problem is with the layering -- that is why this is only 3 stars. First, the ice cream needed to be fully defrosted. Then one needs to dig down to get the full bit. I cant just scoop off the top and work my way to the bottom. I felt like I was drilling to the bottom with each bite. Is there a better way to ""layer"" this?"
25_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,This is by far the BEST of any kind of Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream combo I have ever had!
25_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"Don’t walk, run! Run to the store and try this amazingness! So worth the money!"
25_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,My daughter and I saw a pic of these on social media and saw they were near by. That night we had to have this one. We tried it and couldnt believe the flavor. We love that added textures of crunch to it. This is amazing!
25_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,This is the best flavor by far. Unfortunately it is very hard to find. I have only seen it at Target once and never anywhere else.

25_talenti,3,2.0,1.0,"This flavor- the mint fudge cookie, had the highest ratings; however, I found it to be a disappointment, compared to the salted caramel truffle gelato layers. The flavors were ok in the mint fudge cookie, just nothing to rave about, nothing outstanding whatsoever."
25_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My new favorite! I ate the whole pint in one day ;) the chocolate fudge was AMAZING and then just when I thought it couldn’t get any better, the bottom cookie layer, TO DIE FOR! gonna have to make another trip to the store!"

26_talenti,5,10.0,1.0,This is ridiculously good! Strong egg nog flavor!!
26_talenti,5,9.0,1.0,I first tasted this gelato 3 yrs ago and felt so deliciously intoxicated and delightfully satisfied with the tastes of pure eggnog.. I nearly consumed the entire contents in one sitting... Unfortunately I have not been successful to locate the EggNog flavor in any market in 3 yrs. I plan on strong arming all the markets to return this product by holiday time.
26_talenti,5,7.0,1.0,"After reading the review from the person who said this was wonderful but couldnt find it for three years, I made it a mission to find this flavor this holiday season. As someone who loves both eggnog and Talenti products, I can say that this is amazingly good! I bought three just to be sure i wont be left in despair for three years..."
26_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I have waited all year for this!!! I grew up on home made eggnog and this is the ice version. Its smooth, creamy, and love in a pint. It is one of few flavors that doesnt ""go away"" after eating in for a while. I have cleared space in my deep freezer so I can enjoy this well into Spring."
26_talenti,5,9.0,2.0,"When I discovered this flavor 3 years ago, I stopped buying all other so-called Eggnog ice cream. Unfortunately, this flavor isnt always at the same stores each season, so I keep searching until find them. My last Eggnog gelato was served on July 4th."
26_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,"I love this so much I cant actually allow it in my house. I can only eat it at the office where my nutrition-nut workout crazy no-sugar-allowed boss can cast a criticizing eye over my special treat so Im feeling guilty enough to stop after a few decadent spoonfuls. If I had it at home, I wouldnt stop from the break of the safety deal until the bottom of the pint was carefully licked clean!"
26_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"I like to try flavors Ive never had before and saw this about 3 months ago on sale at my neighborhood supermarket. I gave it a shot. I knew itd be good, because how could you mess up eggnog? I was not dissapointed! I just have to get to the store early when its on sale otherwise this is the first flavor to disappear."
26_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,1 of the ABSOLUTE BEST tasting ice cream flavors of all time!!!

27_talenti,4,4.0,0.0,"I had to rate this 4 stars because it is amazing! I normally would rate lower when an item is missing a claimed ingredient but the brown butter ice cream sorbet is out of control delicious. I fortunately had caramel on hand to add to it myself. It doesn’t necessarily need it as it’s delicious on its own, but this item did claim to have caramel. Like all their others that supposedly contain other items I’m pretty sure they just use a paint brush to swirl on the inside of the container to make you think you’re getting some. Check my pictures if you need proof. I do love most Talenti flavors, but since they still won’t fix the issue of non existent items they claim to have in several of their flavors upon many many reviews it’s time to try other brands on the same level of Talenti. My grocery store now has 5 new lines of ice cream/gelato/sorbet that look delicious and if they contain the items they claim and are as good I will switch, even if they cost more money!"
27_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"Got this $7 pint because I love brown butter ice cream and this was the first time Ive seen an organic version that I hadnt made myself. The ice cream itself is very good, but there is no brown butter butter flavor, it just tastes like dulce de leche ice cream; and there are only caramel swirls against the outside of the container, not actually swirled throughout the ice cream."
27_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Great like seriously the best Ice cream ever. Will recommend to family and friends

30_talenti,5,6.0,1.0,"I have been buying this GELATO for quite a while. But, was shopping at SPROUTS a few days ago and they did not have my Favorite Flavor, VANILLA CARIBBEAN COCONUT, so I bought the VANILLA AGED OAK instead. It was so good, I ate the entire PINT. Usually, a pint lasts me for 3 servings. But I could not stop eating this. I usually buyTALENTI from BASHAS. But they never had this Flavor. Not only is it the best GELATO, Ever; it beats any Ice Cream, FROZEN CUSTARD or anything I have ever eaten, in this category. 0"
30_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,I bought this flavor when (one of my favorites) Madagascan Vanilla Bean was out of stock. The notes of Oak were surprisingly prominent.

30_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my all-time favorite frozen dessert. Not only is the taste perfectly balanced for flavor, sweetness and creaminess vs. smoothness, it is the best flavor and type of dessert for a health problem I have with swallowing. It soothes my throat when I have had trouble getting food down, and the mild,but well-developed taste is perfectly suited to eating the right amount that I need. The only other flavor that works for me is Madagascan Vanilla Bean. Thanks for creating these absolutely delicious (and healing!) frozen treats."

31_talenti,3,10.0,1.0,"Ive had some good quality pistachio (and hazelnut) gelatos in the past at real gelaterias and what I loved about them was how intensely flavored they were. I almost didnt buy this based solely on how light green the gelato was, knowing that it might be a little weak on flavor, and it was. I spent 35 years as a pastry chef and would highly recommend that you take a look into some european made high quality pistachio paste to boost your flavor (and hazelnut paste for your hazelnut flavor). Barring that, I would recommend that you at least double the amount of pistachios you are using. The texture was fine, once it thawed a little, just needs a little (or a lot) more flavor."
31_talenti,5,31.0,4.0,They say it only takes one time to get addicted. Im addicted. This right here is a heavenly addiction.
31_talenti,5,8.0,0.0,Super vivid taste. Very creamy. Has the perfect amount of pistachio chunks throughout. Delicious! This was my second flavor! Love love love.
31_talenti,2,8.0,1.0,"I am disappointed that Talenti changed the Sicilian Pistachio Flavor to Pacific Coast Pistachio Gelato. The taste is not the same and I just dont like it. Supposedly the recipe didnt change but then why are there 60 more calories per serving, 3 more grams of Fat, 15 more grams of Sodium, 6 more grams of Sugar and 10 more grams of Cholesterol. The California nuts may be some of the difference in the taste and calories...I dont know. I dont know why Talenti had to change a great tasting Gelato to something that isnt up to the previous Sicilian Pistachio. I used to buy a lot of the Sicilian Pistachio.....I definitely wont be buying this remake at all thats for sure. Bad move Talenti. Thanks for your review on our Talenti Pacific Coast Pistachio Gelato! Wed like a chance to hear more about this experience, so please reach out to our Consumer Services team directly at consumer.services@unilever.com. We look forward to your email!"
31_talenti,5,12.0,2.0,One of my all time favorites. I love that the pistachios are roasted. It really adds to the flavor. The amount of pistachios are impressive. Straight through there were big chunks!!! Well done Talenti!! Bravissimo!!!!!
31_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,This is seriously one of THE BEST ice cream i ever tasted!
31_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,"Hands down the most amazing pistachio product Ive tasted! A must try for any pistachio lover. Contains tons and tons of actual pistachios, unlike other ice creams/gelatina Ive tried. Good job Talenti, you nailed it!"
31_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"Sadly it’s missing something. I used to think there was almost a faint coconut flavor hidden somewhere in the Sicilian version. There was a richness, a decadence that’s missing with the Pacific coast version. There’s just a flatness to this one. I don’t know if I would get it again whereas I always looked forward to my Sicilian Pistachio. I know I’ve tasted this missing flavor in other pistachio products. Maybe you can bring it back. I’ll probably keep searching for my new favorite pistachio treat, but not if Sicilian was back. It sounds like I’m not alone based on other reviews online. I still ate it all though. Not bad, but you had perfection. Thank you though for making your gelato with such good, natural ingredients. Thank you for reaching out - were sorry to hear about your disappointment. We would be happy to address your concerns further. Please reach out to us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com. We are looking forward to your email!"
31_talenti,2,4.0,0.0,"Talenti Sicilian Pistachio used was my favorite ice cream. When all I could find was the new version, Pacific Coast Pistachio, I tried it. Two thumbs down. Not only are there waaay fewer pistachio pieces in it (their chewiness was part of what made the Sicilian variety special), but the flavor is different too. They say its the same recipe, but I doubt it. This flavor reminds me of boxed pistachio pudding, with a strange, cloying flavor that stays in my mouth for quite a while after eating it. We appreciate your feedback. Were sorry to hear about your disappointing experience with this product. We would love to speak with you further regarding your concerns and invite you to reach out to us at consumer.services@unilever.com. "
31_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"i was so hooked on the sicilian pistachio -- it had a great clean bright pistachio flavor better than any others ive come across in a grocery store. sadly the pacific coast version with its california pistachios is so lacking in flavor its like there are no nuts in it at all. really sad that the nut source has had such an unfortunate effect on flavor. still a nice texture but this no longer satisfies a pistachio craving. wish talenti would switch back to the sicilian pistachios, theyre vastly superior."
31_talenti,5,13.0,3.0,"Love this flavor. What I like most about it besides all the pistachios is the understated flavor - Its sweet but not too sweet. I also like it because it is always available, I can only guess because people are thrown off by the products very light green tint... Silly people."
31_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"This definitely doesnt taste like most pistachio flavors! Its extremely creamy and very lightly sweet if at all. This reminded me of real pistachios blending in milk or cream. Its extremely true to what a pistachio would taste like without sugar and other flavorings. Extremely nutty and rich. I wasnt crazy about it, but I definitely didnt dislike it either. I did enjoy the chunks or real pistachio!"
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I am a great lover of pistachio ice cream, but not so much of pistachio gelato. The flavor would usually disappoint me to the point where I stopped ordering it when visiting a gelato shop. Fortunately, I noticed Talenti made a Sicilian Pistachio flavor and I’m so glad I tried it! It’s creamy, not too sweet and has a good amount of very flavorful pistachios. If you’re expecting a sugary pistachio ice cream taste, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re expecting a delicate flavor with real pistachios that are unbelievably delicious, buy some today!"
31_talenti,2,4.0,0.0,"Actually thought I got a bad batch, went back to freezer and noticed the name change. It doesn’t taste as rich, this is more like a mediocre pistachio ice cream. Just not very good. Considering this was my favorite, just not very good anymore."
31_talenti,3,4.0,0.0,"The Sicilian Pistachio Gelato was much better than the Pacific Coast Pistachio. Please bring back the Sicilian pistachio. Having recently toured Sicily, the idea that I was eating one of their superior ingredients had cache for me. Thanks for your review on our Talenti Pacific Coast Pistachio Gelato! Our team is disappointed to learn that this did not taste great.

31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I came on this website onlyyy to further check out this item. This is literally the best tastiest treat. When I have a bad (or whenever really) I look forward to ending my day with the scilian pistachio ice cream. It reminds me so much of my Spanish grandmother and how she could never find pistachio ice cream in the states (always accidentally getting mint chocolate chip). I wish she was here to try it! There’s nothing that compares. It’s sweet but balanced, and the pistachios and the perfect soft chewy crunch."
31_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I dont like pistachio ice cream, so was surprised to find that I find this one delicious. The texture of ALL Talenti ice creams is perfect, and impossible to stop eating. My favorite thing - the containers! I use them for everything, I must have 40. Anyway back to the pistachio ice cream. It tastes natural and is intense enough, which is not always the case with Talenti ice cream (often too bland)."
31_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"OMG, I am so glad I decided to give this a try. I had been looking for a great pistachio ice cream, and had given up hope on finding something halfway decent. Let me just say, this gelato rocked my world!!!! You have got to try this, and I promise you will be hooked. It has such a pure flavor (Unlike most pistachio ice creams that taste like cold almond extract and sugar)...its not too sweet...and I can taste the quality in every bite."
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I’ve eaten this a lot. It’s amazing. One problem I have had, though, is digging in to a hard frozen chunk of...something. I got it out and melted it and it looks pretty gross. After crushing it and smelling it, seems as though the pistachio flavoring didn’t get mixed in very well. But it was a huge golf ball-sized chunk. Made me a little worried, to be honest, after seeing the fad of licking ice cream in the stores. Hmm- since I brought that up- why don’t you guys have a seal on your containers??? Thanks for sharing your experience! Were disappointed to learn the taste wasnt up to our high quality standards. Please reach out to us at consumer.services@unilever.com so we can gather more details from you. We look forward to speaking with you soon!"
31_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,This is one of the most pure absolute pleasures you can enjoy in this world. Words cannot do justice. Just try this and you will agree.
31_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"The absolute best, rich pistachio flavor and creaminess was so good! Cant wait to buy more!"
31_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Im going to go buy more flavored to try  I had the Sicilian pistachio flavor I can tell and taste how fresh the ingredients were eating this I loved obeyed than regular ice cream
31_talenti,1,14.0,13.0,"I really wanted to like this, but I found the gelato just tasted like cream, and the pistachios could have been any nut"
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely LOVE this gelato! I swear by it and have bragged to so many friends. The taste is rich and creamy, but not too sweet. I usually get tummy aches from eating icecream, and this is the only one that I dont feel sick after eat, but actually feel like a new person! It gives a bump to my spirits and mood because its so light and refreshing while still keeping the rich flavor of a pistachio!"
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the only flavor I have had because I’m totally addicted to it. Whenever I’m at the store I tell myself, try another flavor it’s bound to be good. Then I reach for the pistachio instead because I can’t help myself. Truly heavenly. Then I take it home and tell myself , ok put it away after eaten half of it. Guess what ? FAIL. I eat the whole dang thing. Ridiculous. They had me at first bite."
31_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This Gelato is extremely good, especially the pistachio kind!!"
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I was extremely impressed with the quality, texture and taste of this Talenti Sicilian Pistachio gelato! I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review from Influenster in a contest. Lucky me! This is one decadent dessert! I will be buying some other flavored , they have an amazing assortment. Pistachio has the right amount of nuts blended in. The cream is rich and nutty."
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"So delicious! This was the first time Ive ever tried talenti and I will definitely be buying this again along with other flavors. Sweet but not too sweet, and that hard to describe pistachio flavor was just so awesome. Had to use serious self control to not eat the whole thing. Love the pistachio chunks as well! I think its awesome that there are only a few natural, quality ingredients"
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Fave ..uh, that;s all I was going to write but apparently I need 50 characters? This one is my go-to, and its definitely the best pistachio gelato/ice cream product Ive had, and this is no small thing, considering pistachio has been a favorite flavor since childhood and Im very picky. Just the right level of sweetness, and very well-blended in terms of the actual pistachio chunks."
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,my top choice its not to sweet or not sweet enough u taste the milky and sweetness of it the pistachios are not whole which makes it great to eat not bad for ur teeth and very wholesome taste this is my number #1 flavor I buy and stock 4 at a time it the cheapest it ever is in my area would be 3$5$ 3 for $10 sometimes theres 4 stores in my area and sometimes I buy them out
31_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My most very favorite is the Sicilian Pistachio. And that is saying something because I have always been a chocoholic. But after finding this wonderful pistachio, I care for nothing else. Unfortunately, in recent weeks, I cannot find the pistachio. Either it is not heavily stocked in my local Kroger or someone else loves it as much as I do."
31_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,I recently got the pacific coast pistachio gelato because I couldn’t find the Sicilian pistachio that I love and it barely has any flavor! I thought it was just a name change but it definitely does not taste as good as the Sicilian! Unfortunately I have to find another brand. Sad
31_talenti,2,2.0,1.0,"I have been very happy with talent products so far. I just returned from a trip to Italy and tasted my first pistachio gelato. It was amazing! This product was bland by comparison. You may enjoy it, but if youve ever had it in Italy you will be disappointed in this version."
31_talenti,4,2.0,1.0,"I have trusted the Talenti brand for gelato; however, the Sicilian Pistachio was simply green slush. I neither saw nor tasted one pistachio in the entire pint. Threw the last 3/4 away. I was surprised that it lacked overall flavor and not one measly pistachio."
31_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"Love this flavor! Its light and flavorful without being too sweet. Wish there were more pieces of pistachios! My only complaint is that the lids are nearly impossible to initially open plus would like a plastic cover on the top, which might help the lids open."
31_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I purchased two of these. One from CVS and the other on base. The lids have been extra tight to the point I had to take pliers to open it. Yes, I let it thaw out for 5 minutes. Lol overall I love all of these. Though, I wish they would change the lid."
31_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"If you ever been to Sicilia and had an ice cream you would know the difference. The amount of pistachios was fine but the tase was cream and sugar no taste of pistachios at all Didn’t really like it We appreciate your review of our Sicilian Pistachio Gelato!

31_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"If it weren’t for the chunks of pistachio in it, I wouldn’t be able to tell it’s pistachio. Disappointing flavor"
31_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"Sicilian pistachio is a favorite; however, they changed the flavors and it’s just not the same."
32_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"I honestly didnt know how much I would like this since it is dairy free, but it is really tasty. It has a nice, smooth rich taste. A nice strong peanut butter taste. The fudge swirl is good and not overpowering. I love that it has a screw on cover, I feel it keeps longer thanks to the tight seal. Very minimal ingredients is awesome. It is made with coconut oil and is pretty high in sugars, but its not something I could sit and eat the whole pint in one sitting. It is a nice upscale home dessert. product was received at no charge."
32_talenti,5,22.0,1.0,"I have been vegan for over 10 years now and thought I have tried every dairy free brand of ice cream. My daughter picked this up, I didnt even look at it until we got home. I didnt know it was dairy free. OMG I had one bite and it is the best dairy free ice cream I have ever tasted. Its so creamy and smooth and full of peanut butter and chocolate. I had to get on your website because I simply couldnt believe it was dairy free. Im in big trouble now, and its a great price too. Thank you so much for the most incredible dessert I have ever put in my mouth."
32_talenti,5,7.0,1.0,"The very best frozen sweet treat! The texture will fool you at first bite. So creamy and smooth. I REALLY like that its not studded with nuts or other crunchy stuff. If thats your style, you can add your choice. Thank you Talenti for all your awesome products."
32_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"I cant have any dairy at all, so I gravitate to non-dairy frozen desserts and sorbettos. I saw this while in NC visiting our daughter and HAD to try it. I get tired of fruit flavored sorbets, which are the norm. I was totally blown away! SO rich and tasty! Best treat in a long time! I could only handle about 1/4 C at a time due to the richness, which is so satisfying. At 15 gr. of fat per 1/2 C serving, it isnt health food by any means, but boy, when you need a special treat, this is amazing! Keep up the good work, Talenti!"
32_talenti,3,3.0,1.0,The first two times we bought the peanut butter fudge sorbetto there were three thick ribbons of fudge going from the top to the bottom. The last two times there is only a couple of spots of fudge at the bottom of the container. Please bring back the the ribbons of thick fudge throughout the container.
32_talenti,5,14.0,2.0,"Thank you for this most incredible flavor sorbetto! Im in heaven with this flavor. The peanut butter is creamy with just the right amount of fudge. Contrary to another reviewer, I dont find this flavor too sweet. In fact, I dont think its very sweet at all. If I didnt know better, I would have sworn this was gelato and not sorbetto. Its that good!"
32_talenti,5,10.0,1.0,"I tried some Peanut Butter Fudge Sorbetto and had to check the label again to make sure it contained no milk, as it was so rich and creamy. The flavors are perfectly balanced. This is an amazing product!"
32_talenti,5,9.0,1.0,"If you love peanut butter, you MUST try this product. This is now my all time favorite dessert!! My boyfriend isnt a fan of peanut butter so he wasnt too fond of it, but if youre a crazy peanut butter person like me - this is a dream come true!!!"
32_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,This is incredible! I was always so sad because I had to give up my beloved talenti. Now I dont. Honestly if I could eat dairy Id still buy this. Amazing that this is dairy free. Beats any other non dairy product on the market and Ive tried them all!!! Make more flavors!!
32_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"I had this rather regretfully since I try to avoid dairy. It was the best flavor Ive ever had so I didnt mind having consumed dairy to be able to enjoy it. Two days later, I found out it is dairy free and I was to the moon with happiness! The texture was spot on so I didnt even suspect this to be dairy-free. Favorite hands down, and will enjoy again soon!!!! Soooo yummy."
32_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Woman with allergies I have a dairy ALERGY. Its not something I can take a pill for and be ok. No its terrible if it get any dairy. Your chocolate sorbetto and your peanutbutter fudge sorbetto is amazing and I have ZERO ISSUES eating it. It almost makes me want to cry in happiness because I cant have ice cream anymore but these are excellent because they truly are dairy free. Most people say ""dairy free"" and they use soy or coconut milk or what not and I CANT DO THAT, Im also allergic to those but your Sorbettos are wonderful. Please come up with vanilla or other flavors too. I love them and would stock pile those. Oh and when you came up with chocolate and peanutbutter fudge thats excellent. So many people that make sorbetto only have fruit flavors and you get sick of mango and raspberry all the time when you cant have good ice cream you know? Thank you so much for making this delicious ingenious stuff!!"
32_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The texture and flavor or the peanut butter fudge sorbetto is unlike anything ive had before. absolutely mind-boggling that it doesnt have any dairy! i am in love with this flavor. Ive only been able to find this flavor at Sprouts Farmers Market but i hope itll make its way around to other vendors soon!
32_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My husband cant eat dairy products, but loves ice cream. I found this for him to try and he fell in love with it. I have seen him eat the whole thing in one sitting! He says it tastes exactly like fudge grandma used to make. Thank you for making a product my husband can eat that actually tastes good!"
32_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is hands down the smoothest, creamiest non dairy frozen treat Ive ever had. Like other reviewers said, I checked the label again because I couldnt believe its vegan. Thank you so much Talenti. Please keep making more sorbettos like this!"
32_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite! Not sure what happened to the formula for this, but it’s now got chunks of peanuts in it and very little fudge swirl. It has a chalk like consistency. Very bummed out."
32_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,so im dairy free and found this along with the dairy free rasberry sorbetto and i tried both of them together and they work so good!! it tastes like pb and j. soo good.

33_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I am not a peanut butter flavored person so I was really reluctant on trying this flavor however, its absolutely amazing the peanut butter is strong enough for you to know that its peanut butter but not overpowering it is so soft and creamy in the bit of crunching it is just awesome Im so glad I found Telenti!! Im looking forward to try and more flavors and I hope that you wont stop making layers and other flavors!"
33_talenti,5,17.0,2.0,"I honestly didn’t expect it to taste so good. I enjoyed every single bite except for the vanilla flavor at the bottom. I had already eaten the peanut butter flavor, fudge and peanut butter cup pieces. When i buy this again i May get extra chocolate syrup because the vanilla tasted off like it didn’t belong. I wish they would have done another layer of the peanut butter gelato then the cookie pieces and kept the vanilla out."
33_talenti,2,7.0,0.0,"I love Talenti! So when I saw the new layers gelato I was so excited. I picked the peanut butter one and tried it right away. Overall it was just mehh. The gelatos texture was all wrong, reminded me of light ice cream. Then finally got down to the peanut butter cookies and they had no flavor and not much crunch :( so disappointed!"
33_talenti,2,2.0,1.0,"The layers are a delicious combination. Unfortunately, unless one overeats and consumes all three servings in the container, to eat from the container in three sittings would be two servings of eating separate layers. Great concept, but it overreaches, unless they were to be made in single serving sizes, perhaps 4-packs. The design encourages eating 1,050 calories at at one sitting, so I would rather just buy some Peanut Butter and Vanilla Gelato and make my own sundae at home, and consume less calories that way!"
33_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,The peanut butter crunchy deliciousness is what i’ve been searching for!! A must try!
33_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This gelato layer flavor is just delicious. The right combination of peanut butter, vanilla, and chocolate, which includes both fudge and little chocolate candies. I will be trying the other flavors, but I suspect this will be my favorite. Sorry, can’t include photo in this review, as I devoured the entire pint just now!"
33_talenti,1,4.0,1.0,"The peanut flavor is so mild the vanilla gelato layer overpowers it. The pb cookie pieces have no taste, just yuck compared to other flavors. I would not recommend this flavor at all"
33_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My husband loves your gelato. Esp. anything peanut butter. He devours it. And best part is that when he is done, he saves the container to put screws, nuts etc. in it since it is clear he can see what he has. We have tried other flavors and they are out of this world. Thank you for a wonderful product."
33_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I couldnt wait to try this when I got home from shopping. With spoons in hand, my husband and I dived right in. Wow! Cant wait to try other flavors. The layering is perfect because you you get a perfect bite in every spoonful!"

34_talenti,1,6.0,1.0,"So this used to be the best gelato. I used to wait every year for it to come back. This year for some reason its barely minty and its not chocolate flakes its waxy hard chunks. It still says flakes on the container, but its not. It almost tastes like a minty vanilla with wax chunks. So bummed :("
34_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,"There is no peppermint candies nor any peppermint extract listed in the ingredients despite the ""Recipe"" on the side claiming white chocolate and ""peppermint gelato"". Even the Mediterranean Mint tastes better for a holiday occasion. The chocolate pieces are chalky. I dont how this flavor gets raved about except for some kind of placebo effect. Im also concerned that Talenti might be going down in quality as it branches out to do their Gelato layers. Im genuinely considering going back to other brands that have remained consistent in quality and have really outdone themselves with their holiday flavors."
34_talenti,5,25.0,0.0,Its the best. I always have it served at parties as well as nightly desert time
34_talenti,5,10.0,0.0,OMG. This gelato is THE best peppermint frozen concoction ever. Ive been an ardent fan of all things peppermint since I was a kid and my mom would take me to Thrifty Drugstore for an ice cream cone. Itd always be a triple decker. And it was always peppermint all the way. Only bad thing about this flavor / its only available seasonally.
34_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,Last year during the holidays I discovered Peppermint Bark. It is incredible!!! This year a stopped at a couple of stores that carry Talenti - but alas no Peppermint Bark. The stores said it sold out as soon as it arrived. When they tried to re-order it was unavailable. This is a great tasting gelato - why not have it available all year.
34_talenti,1,5.0,0.0,I was looking forward to Peppermint bark this year and when I finally was able to find it in store i was absolutely disappointed. the flavor was to light. Barely any mint flavor . Just taste like vanilla and big chunks of chocolate! What a waste. Will never buy it again.

34_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,This is the best mint chip ice cream. Flecks of chocolate instead of chunks. This needs to be here all year round. PLEASE
34_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"I love Talenti gelato and I just tried the Peppermint Bark for the first time this season. It is amazing. I went back for more and its gone already. Nooo!! The peppermint flavor is outstanding and I love that the chips are lighter and more delicate than the Mediterranean Mint, which is my usual go-to flavor. Only complaint is that I cant find it now."
34_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,THIS IS THE BEST GELATO IVE EVER HAD. NOTHING COMPARES. I WANT TO EAT IT FOR EVERY MEAL. MY ONE ISSUE IS THAT NO STORES HAVE IT IN STOCK AND IM SCARED.
34_talenti,2,7.0,3.0,I am a huge fan of Talenti and peppermint bark. This flavor did not deliver for me. It was okay at best and for some reason the texture was kinda chalky. The flavor was ok but the chalky consistency turned me off.
34_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,This is like a Christmas explosion in your mouth! I loved that it tasted like the peppermint bark candy!
34_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Peppermint is my favorite flavor and Talenti gelato is a must buy. So I expected a little bit of heaven when I bought this. Not so much. The vanilla flavor was OK and there were definitely chips of some kind there, but...I couldn’t taste ANY peppermint. it just was a mild, not very good, vanilla flavor. Sooo disappointed. I’ve never done this with any Talenti product, but I threw it ou."
34_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"For years for years Ive been an obsessed fan of your Peppermint Bark. I would literally buy 10 pints at a time!

34_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is one of the very greatest ice cream / gelatos made.
34_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Awesome taste, an not heavy on your stomach. Gluten free."
35_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,Number 30 is probably one of the best recipes Talentis have made. I love all of the spices. It isnt over powering. The chunks of pie are delightful. Just an all around great gelato for the holidays.
35_talenti,5,11.0,2.0,This is absolutely AMAZING! It taste EXACTLY like pumpkin pie! So happy I found this! Bring on the sweater weather with a pint of this!
35_talenti,5,13.0,2.0,"I am literally IN LOVE with this stuff (and to be honest I am eating some RIGHT NOW) - It literally taste like pumpkin pie. You can really taste the nutmeg. I mean there is nothing I would change. Please make this year wrong! Please! I apologize to everyone living in Columbia/Elkridge, MD because I buy the case out whenever I find this flavor because it is so hard to find. I love it!!!!!! I literally have 10 in my fridge right now lol. (Single mom... gotta do what you have to do)"
35_talenti,5,9.0,1.0,"Cmon -- pumpkin is everywhere and oddly enough in coffee! Do you believe for a second there is any REAL pumpkin in there? So, even as the fourth ingredient behind the major players in gelato ingredients, that in itself was impressive! PUMPKIN! Now, the bad thing is that is kind of is like pumpkin pie in that maybe Ill just have another sliver (or two or three). The only thing I wont do is microwave it! LOL But I bet it would be good! (I might have to try it - LOL)."
35_talenti,5,11.0,1.0,"Very rich, lots of spice to mimic pumpkin pie. Whole family loves it. We found this by trying to stay away from corn syrup, glad we found this, every other ice cream brand has high fructose. Thanks, were hesitant to try because of price, but the pumpkin was on sale for 50% off, glad we did, wish price was less though."
35_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,"Pumpkin pie gelato is not too sweet, with well-balanced spices. Its vegetal but rich, creamy but wholesome. And the tiny bits of buttery pie crust provide a nice contrast to the custardy main event. This stuff takes that whole pumpkin spice thing to a new level."
35_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"Usually with food, the taste that is marketed isnt the end-result taste. But for this product, you definitely taste Pumpkin Pie. It is very good and has bits of pumpkin pie, which add to the experience. It was a pretty cool surprise when my friends and I first tried it; we werent expecting the taste at all. The size is good for one person, but not for sharing since its really good."
35_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,"Perfect flavor! <3 You need to try this product ASAP! If you love pumpking pie, this is the gelato for you!!! <3"
35_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,SO DELICIOUS AND PERFEC TFOR THE SEASON!!!!! PICKED IT UP TODAY AND ALMOST DEVOURED IT ALL
35_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,literally my favorite in the world not an ice cream person but I wait every year for November to come so I can go ham ITS SO TICH N DELICIOUS I can taste it as I type omg and buy and stock up but it usually disappears lol
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I consider myself a pumpkin junkie, like all things pumpkiny, but nothing excites me for the fall like this pumpkin pie gelato, it is absolutely the best, second to none flavored ice cream/gelato you can put in your mouth, I used to look forward to pumpkin pie blizzards but they go to the back burner as long as I can find Talentis’ pumpkin pie gelato, the only problem is it’s only available a short time in season, so as always I’ll stock up to get me through a couple of weeks...."
35_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Okay never did I think I would be writing an ice cream review but I just want to let you all know that this is by far my favorite ice cream so far. I have tried the majority of your flavors and this one is out of this world. It tastes exactly like pumpkin pie!!!! I really hope it isn’t seasonal and I can buy it year round.
35_talenti,5,6.0,2.0,I wish this was available year round- I LOVE it!!!!!
35_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"Talenti has elevated pumpkin pie to the moon! This is my very favorite of all the gelato flavors I have tried, I must have gotten the last one that was hidden away. Its way, way too bad its seasonal. When I see it again I will buy at least half a dozen, its that good. Both pistachio and coffee chocolate chip glato will be in my freezer until then. Thanks Talenti, youre my fave, and 2-3 assorted flavors are always a much appreciated hostess gift."
35_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,This was surprisingly amazing it was like eating a pumpkin pie but better . I wish this was a year-round flavor not seasonal .
35_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"Again, this is ridiculous. Amazing taste. Will most likely be banned in several countries due to the absurdity of it all."
35_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Love love love this! I ate the entire container in one sitting. I just couldn’t stop. It is soooooo yummy! I love pumpkin pie, love rgis pumpkin pie gelato! I love the pieces of pie crust, nice touch. I highly recommend it."
35_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This is the best icecream that I have ever had. I can’t get over the fact that it was so good. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. My new favorite ice cream??? Yesssssss!!!!!!! I love it can’t wait to buy more.
35_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Be still my beating heart! Love my grannies pumpkin pie, but this gelato(paired with chocolate sugar cookie) is divine."
35_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Soooo delicious!!!! Taste just like ice cream on pumpkin pie!
35_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,The most amazing pumpkin flavored gelato Ive ever had!!! So sad its seasonal because I am on my last pint. Super creamy and the pumpkin pie pieces are so yummy! Love this flavor!
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The flavor overall is great. There is pieces of “pie crust” which is very good and sugary. The spice level is perfect and cuts the sweetness to create a good sweet/ spice ratio. the texture of the gelato compliments the smooth pumpkin. I love chilled pumpkin pie, but this takes it to another level. 100% recommend to everyone."
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My wife and I wanted some ice cream... saw this and were skeptical at first. I don’t care for pumpkin spice coffees or anything, but gimme some pumpkin pie/pumpkin cheesecake and OOOOOF! This ice cream doesn’t just slap, it SLAPS SLAPS! Whatever you do pumpkin pie lovers, gon’ & get your this ice cream, because again, OOOOF!"
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this flavor! I have only had this flavor once, but I immediately fell in love with it! I am so glad when I found it again, especially since it was not discontinued! The pieces of crust in this ice cream bring it up a few levels and makes it a better expirence too!"
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I am hooked. This gelato is clearly made from the real ingredients found in pumpkin pie, including small chips of pie crust! It tastes exactly like pumpkin pie. It is the best holiday-related ice cream I have ever had. You will love it!"
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I am so glad I picked this up from the store. After my first bite my only thought was, ""This could only be better if it had pieces of crust in it."" And sure enough on my next bite I got one. So good."
35_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,This is my new favorite flavor -- and is also the best of the pumpkin ice creams I have tried (and there have been many). Theres no reason not to keep it around longer!
35_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,This pumpkin frozen treat is the best out there but it extremely rare to find.
35_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Sooo good. Doesnt hold back on 8th nutmeg, love it"
36_talenti,2,8.0,5.0,I love cheesecake and love raspberry however this flavor came up short in a couple ways. The cheesecake flavor itself is wonderful however there is a lack of raspberry. There is ZERO raspberry flavoring in the middle of the pint it just small amounts around the outside which is a major disappointment. The cheesecake chunks are a good idea but they are poorly executed. They are MASSIVE pieces like tablespoon sized or larger. On top of size they have an odd overly lemon flavor thats extremely off putting. Over all this flavor is disappointing and probably not one that I would get again.
36_talenti,2,6.0,0.0,"I used to love this, this was legitimately my favorite flavor! It had actual cheesecake chunks in it, and I would buy it even when it wasnt on sale! I just recently purchased a pint because I have bought one in forever, and now, it only has graham cracker crust pieces. The recipe has completely changed, it has coconut oil (I could taste the coconut!) and palm oil in it now; the ice cream almost feels dry when I take it out of the freezer. It leaves such a weird mouth-coating feel in my mouth now. It used to be so creamy! Im disappointed and wont buy another pint of this flavor. This one just really sucks now."
36_talenti,1,8.0,0.0,"This is used to be my favorite ice cream and ice cream flavor of all time! What’s up with this new recipe? The ice cream taste weird, so much in fact I had to check the date on the bottom to make sure it wasn’t spoiled! The raspberry swirl tast very off and too tart (nothing like the sweet smooth taste before) and the cheesecake bites are GONE!!!?? Now there’s nothing left but hard pieces of crust that have no flavor and adds nothing to the fact this is supposed to be a Cheesecake ice cream! I was so in love with the chunky REAL cheesecake bites before and the smooth vanilla ice cream flavor! Please bring it back! Would not recommend this ice cream under this recipe! I’m so sad about this."
36_talenti,3,5.0,0.0,"The raspberry cheesecake gelato is usually my favorite but this time the raspberry swirls seems to taste more like a sweetened balsamic vinaigrette and there was just gram cracker pieces instead of the key lime pie pieces (at least thats what it taste like to me). I think a raspberry, black berry blend jam swirl would taste yummy with pieces of some classic New York cheesecake pieces mixed in."
36_talenti,4,20.0,2.0,"Its safe to say Ive eaten over 500 pints of this gelato. My wife can vouch. I normally would eat one every night and occasionally two in a day; however, as of last year, I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cheesecake. Some batches had creamy cheesecake and others had a harder, chewy, unpleasant cheesecake. It got to the point that I would make a notation of the best by dates on the ones with good cheesecake and avoid the dates with the bad cheesecake. I would drive to several different stores on a day off to buy up all that I could of the good ones and had to store overflow in the in laws deep freezer. Lately there have been only been a few with good cheesecake. There would sometimes be a one day variation on best by dates and one good, one not. For instance, may 2nd had some good ones, mar 8th, jul 11th, oct 3 and 4th...all bad. Thats just the recent dates off the top of my head. I had begun to try different flavors but nothing could replace the cheesecake that once was very consistent and now more consistently bad than good. I love it so much that Ill still buy it and just discard the cheesecake but its always disappointing because its never the same as when you get the creamy cheesecake batches. Please can someone from talenti tell me why or what happened? -sad but still want to be loyal, probably your biggest fan."
36_talenti,1,15.0,1.0,"I have recently bought this favorite flavor of mine and it tasted nothing like it normally does. Instead of the wonderful cheesecake flavor it tasted like plain vanilla. The cheesecake pieces were hard little cookies. It was gross. I took it back to the store and got a refund and bought another one thinking it was a fluke. When I got home and opened the new one it tasted exactly like the disgusting one I had just returned. This has me wondering if you have changed the recipe? I really hope that you did not because this new one is awful and tastes nothing like raspberry or cheesecake and the “cheesecake pieces” are hard,tasteless cookies. It’s very disappointing. The raspberry cheesecake used to be my favorite indulgence I allowed myself to have when I needed a pick me up. Please change the recipe back!"
36_talenti,2,2.0,1.0,"I used to love this flavor. It was my favorite. I loved this ice cream soo much I Would buy 3 containers at a time because it was hard to find...but this new recipe is not the business! I loved the cheesecake pieces in the old recipe. And the ice cream taste better. There was only one other ice cream brand that put cheesecake pieces in their ice cream, but it didnt taste as good as this one...and now you guys changed that and even the ice cream part doesnt do it for me. I wish you guys would have kept the old recipe. Now I have 2 other containers of this stuff thatll sit in my freezer or end up in the trash. Which really sucks because this stuff isnt cheap."
36_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,I am in heaven!!!! It takes me to the softest sweet raspherry cheeessseeeeeee cake goodness!! Sooo delicious and I cant stop and wont stop. Takes me back to my childhood raspeherry chesseeeeee cake I ate on holidays :)
36_talenti,2,2.0,1.0,Ive never had gelato so I thought Id try something new and finally decided on the raspberry cheesecake flavor. Love the container. Upon opening it I took in a smell almost like sour cream. I took a bite and was overwhelmed with the same taste as freezing my yogurt containers to eat as a frozen treat. Maybe this is how gelato is supposed to taste? I have nothing to compare it to. The raspberry swirl was good but sparce. The cheesecake bites were meh. I did like the consistency of the product but overall the sour taste just made this a bad choice for me. I wanted so much to be in love with gelato but this flavor or maybe if all gelato is sour I will have to pass from now on. Very disappointed.
36_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"I am not sure when this happened - but Talenti changed the recipe for the Raspberry Cheesecake gelato and I am heartbroken. It was my favorite ice cream/gelato flavor of any brand! It used to be a cheesecake flavored ice cream with raspberry swirl and actual cheesecake pieces! Now it is cream cheese ice cream with the swirl and graham crust pieces (small and sad compared to the cheesecake pieces). I am worried that this stems from new ownership and a desire to make the fillings cheaper. I am so disappointed..... and Talenti lost some of my business. This is a dramatic review, which is so unusual for me but I was shocked when I excitedly opened a jar recently and was met with pure disappointment!"
36_talenti,1,4.0,1.0,"Recently got this favorite of my families and we noticed it looks & taste like the recipe has been complete changed up...this sadened us greatly. We use to absolutely love the unique taste of this recipe. The ice cream was daresay perfect with how light it treated, perfectly complimentedlay raspberry and cheesecake. This new recipe just seems like every other vanilla ice cream. Much heavier and the raspberry seems tartier. If the recipe is changed, please change it back, we began you! We have not changed the recipe, so it may just be a slight variance in the batch that you received! Please send us an email so we can make this right for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us"
36_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,Ive been experimenting with different gelatos and Talenti brand flavors for a few months and this is excellent. Best cheesecake gelato ever! Its tied for first place with Sea Salt Caramel. So far these 2 flavors are better than frozen dessert Ive ever had from ice cream parlor. Still have a few more flavors to try!!
36_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this raspberry gelato so much that I have it almost every night. Buy lately I have noticed a difference in its consistency. Some batches taste like just any ordinary vanilla ice cream. I had some tonight and was very disappointed. There were absolutely no cheesecake bites in it at all. Have you changed the recipe or something? I bought 8 of them and so far 3 of them have had no cheesecake bits in them. Please, please go back to the original recipe. It was the best! Sincerely raspberry cheesecake fanatic !"
36_talenti,4,4.0,1.0,So wonderful. Smooth taste. I wanted to stick to a fourth of the container but I couldnt ask I was watching tv!
36_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite ice cream! I tend to prefer chocolate flavors over fruit, but this is my new all time favorite. It tastes EXACTLY like a fresh baked cheesecake with raspberry topping. Amazing!"
36_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"I wasnt expecting the gelato itself to be so sweet and creamy, instead more along the lines of a cream cheese flavor. However, when paired with the raspberry and chunks of cheesecake (oh my god, yum), it takes self control not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. Definitely buying again."
36_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,I bought this thinking that it would have cheesecake pieces in the ice cream which was listed in the description & it only had 2 pieces in the whole container! So disappointing!
36_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"If you dont like cheesecake, dont go for this. But if you do, you should be pleasantly pleased. Very thick ... the consistency is very similar to cheesecake. As a cheesecake lover, I found this to be delicious. Ive never had ice cream quite like this... !"
36_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Just got this flavor after trying many others (including some ""weird ones"") and always enjoying them. Got this one thinking it would be another winner, and yet, not. Just tastes off and a bit overly tart and just not a satisfying dessert. Honestly, not sure Ill even finish the pint. Going to stick to the caramels, crunches, nuts, etc. in the future... Were sorry to hear that you didnt enjoy this flavor! Please send us an email so we can make this right for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us"
36_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Honestly the best i ever had, every bite is filled with perfect amount of a cheesy flavor. takes just like cheesecake. the raspberry which has just the right amount of sweetness and ties in together with the cheeesecake chunks that have a hint of lemon which makes this the perfect dessert"
36_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Talentis Raspberry Cheesecake gelato is exceptional. Savoring the cream cheese flavor and enjoying its creaminess make me feel like Im commiting a sin. This has got to be my all-time favorite ice cream, hands down. Dont change anything about this product. Ever."
36_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The taste and flavor combinations are incredible. The Raspberry Cheesecake combination has become my favorite. The balance of raspberry and cheesecake is incredibly pleasing to my palate.
37_talenti,5,9.0,0.0,Love this flavor! It just makes my day when I eat it!
37_talenti,4,18.0,1.0,"I grabbed this product on a whim as I was craving an entirely different flavor. I didnt really look at it that well (the intense red lured me in) and only when I got home, I realized that I wasnt too excited about this flavor. But reading that it was both raspberry and lemon, it couldnt be THAT bad right? Well, I was surely happy when I first tried it. As I thought, the nice fruity taste was a nice delicious light and refreshing taste. It didnt have the after-taste that the dairy flavors had and left me feeling cool. Its good for a nice little dessert after a dinner, especially a heavy-ish one that leaves you wanting something less dense. Would definitely recommend."
37_talenti,4,3.0,0.0,"I have tried several of the Talenti gelato flavors before and enjoyed them, but I recently decided to try their Roman Raspberry sorbetto. It did not disappoint. It had a very pure sweet tart raspberry flavor (maybe just a tiny bit too sweet for my preference, but still well balanced). I also thought the texture was excellent. It was smooth and velvety and not at all icy. Even after waiting a few days to have another serving, the texture and flavor tasted fresh. I wonder if their containers help with that or if they are just good looking. Either way, you can tell this is a quality brand all the way around and this flavor is no exception. I received a free container of this sorbetto from Influenster."
37_talenti,5,29.0,2.0,"My grandmother had a raspberry bush when I was young, and my brothers and I used to pick the ripe berries right off of the bush and eat them. In the warm summer afternoons, perfumed by flowers and freshly cut grass, the raspberries were perfectly sweet, aromatic, and bursting with juice. I hadnt thought about those raspberries or those carefree days with family in a long time, and then when I tasted this sorbetto for the first time, I was right there in that backyard again. The flavor of freshly picked raspberries had a powerful nostalgic effect on me, and this is now my favorite frozen dessert."
37_talenti,5,13.0,0.0,"Full disclosure: I own a gelato maker that has a compressor, so I can make gelato at home, any time I like. Raspberry is my favorite flavor to make, but its also expensive (frozen raspberries arent cheap), and more time consuming to make than other flavors (defrost raspberries, puree, separate the pulp from the seeds, etc.). The taste of Talentis Roman Raspberry Sorbetto is identical to my own homemade, and per ounce, costs about the same as making it myself. I find the balance of tart and sweet to be perfect; that being said, its a bold flavor, in my opinion, so if youre so-so on raspberries generally, you may not find this to your liking. (Thats okay; more for ME!). Highly recommend to my fellow raspberry lovers everywhere!"
37_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,My favorite sherbet in the whole world. I can eat a whole pint to myself. Absolutely delicious!
37_talenti,5,11.0,0.0,"Talenti, as a brand, I have always loved. Their unique flavors and variety makes them one of my favorite brands of food. However, there is something about this particular flavor that is irresistible! I don’t think I have ever craved something as much as I crave Roman Raspberry. The number of nights I have spent working on my computer with this container of this pure deliciousness in one hand are countless. Please, never stop producing this insanely good sorbetto, I don’t think I could live happily without this product. (;"
37_talenti,5,44.0,4.0,"Wow simply wow. The only con is that it is a little on the pricey side for just 1 pint. Besides that this is amazing. Rich sweet/ tart flavor, smooth texture, not too many ingredients, and always leaving you wanting more. I wish you guys sold big jars of this sorbetto just like those other gelato flavors. Would gladly pay for it."
37_talenti,5,10.0,1.0,"The first spoonful was tart and full of a ttangy, lemony aftertaste. There is no dairy, but you wouldnt know it by the rich, full bodied taste. After I had demolished the entire pint, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was only 120 calories per half cup, not thousands as I had anticipated. Worth every penny...."
37_talenti,5,6.0,0.0,Delicious!! I was not able to eat dairy for a period of time and this was a great time for me to try the Roman Raspberry flavor. Its amazing!! The flavor is devine and its low in calorie - how can you go wrong!? You canont!
37_talenti,4,9.0,2.0,I love that this sorbetto is basicly frozen raspberries. This treat showcases the best qualities of the raspberry in all of its tart-sweet goodness.
37_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I was buying several pints of my favorite gourmet ice cream when the checker suggested Talenti. Id never heard of it but thought Id give it a try. The Roman Raspberry was shockingly delicious. A friend brought by a basket of fresh raspberries the other day. They were pretty good. I offered her some TRR and she came to the same conclusion that I did, this stuff tastes more like raspberries than fresh raspberries!!! The TRR is almost gone now but the ice cream I bought has not even been opened. I want to try the other Talenti flavors but while they might be wonderful, and they might be just a good, they cant possibly be better. Intense, clean, fresh, long lasting flavor. Ingredient list is impressively simple. The best sorbet, sherbet, gelato I have ever tasted. Perhaps the best frozen desert I have ever tasted. Deserves to be shared."
37_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"This stuff is to die for: ridiculously intense (there must be 1000 berries in every pint), with an icy-creamy texture, and just enough tartness to make it refreshing instead of cloying. It is awesome on its own, but even better when paired with a creamy gelato or ice cream for contrast."
37_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"I’ve seen this in the store before but never bought it because of the price and never really looked at it, but then yesterday I bought it and im so glad! The taste is absolutely amazing, and reminds me of when I would take trips to Germany when I was little and we would get gelato!!"
37_talenti,3,3.0,2.0,"I absolutely lovedddd this flavor until about 2 months ago. Potentially my favorite Talenti flavor. Ever since then, every time I purchase it thinking, ""last one was just a bad batch,"" I continue to get a metallic after-taste. I came to the site specifically to see if anyone else felt this way and without looking deep into the comments, I saw a recent one that validated these thoughts; Thank you cin2018. Its so sad that the last 4 pints Ive purchased have a lingering chemical flavor that sticks along past the delicious burst of raspberry. I started noticing the taste around the same time the white ""Dairy-free"" accent was added to the label. I hope its just a very large bad batch, and its not that the recipe took a turn south. Ill be steering clear of this flavor for a bit to test this hypothesis </3."
37_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,My coworker told me about her favorite is pistachio. She purchased every pint on the shelf. We both had coupons to save $4.00 on two and $1.75 on sale. They are regular price $5.19 at VGs but was on sale for $3.99. So I purchased Roman Raspberry sorbetto and Butter Pecan. Love Raspberry. Found the Mango at Walmart hopefully I will fall in love with this flavor.
37_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"The perfect balance of sweet and tart, with a smooth texture that delights the palate."
37_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"It has a very rich, sweet taste and the texture just makes you want more and more."
37_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"I love this. I was not going to buy this until I saw someone pick it up and I decided to give it a try. Its like Im eating a fresh raspberry. I love that. Most sorbets or fruit based things dont taste like the real fruit. The flavor was not masked by other random flavors. It tasted fresh, fruity with a hint of lemon."
37_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"If you love the flavor of fresh raspberries with a touch of lemon, you will love this sorbetto. Not too sweet, great taste and refreshing. I buy this everytime I go to the store. Would be fabulous in a smoothie and great on its own A never fail snack or dessert for guests."
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"My boyfriend and I are addicted to this flavor, we keep going back to buy more. We fell in love from first bite and polished off two pints that night and went back for more the next day. The richness and texture is absolutely divine! I dont mind the price for how high quality the product is, and Ive recommended this to as many people as possible! Please please make this in quart size, 1 pint isnt enough!"
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is the best sorbetto I have tasted. Its has a clean, refreshing taste and is not overly taser or sweet. Im not a big raspberry fan but Ive eaten 2 pints in 2 days. Did I mention my 11.5 month old loves to have this as a mid-afternoon snack. He will eat lunch and then about 2-3 cubes(I portion size for his meals in ice trays) and is a happy camper."
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Its one of my favorite snacks. Not being able to have dairy it can be hard finding frozen snacks. The flavor is incredible the only thing I would change is possibly the fact that it is very sweet still... I wish there was a sugar free option. No necessarily with artificial sweetener but just none at all. Fruit tends to have its own natural sweetness
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I love this so much. I have diet restrictions that requires me to a low fat and low fiber diet. It has been hard to find a low fat frozen treat that actually tastes like a naughty treat. This has everything you want in a frozen treat while fitting in my diet. I have only found this once but I will keep looking for this great treat.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is the ONLY true raspberry sorbetto you can get that actually tastes like raspberries. Its made with raspberries and doesnt have any weird flavors to it. Best you can get without a 2nd thought. Been getting this stuff for years. Its an easy go to sweet desert especially if you cant have dairy! Its dairy free!
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Once again, you all cease to amaze me! Ive seen this flavor in the store before; and never thought to purchase this? ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY FANTASTIC! I have never had something so delicious in my life! Thank you so much for all of your deliciousness! Keep it up! I dont care how much you cost, Ill Still buy it!"
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I got this on a whim, and now I am hooked for life! Its pricey but worth it! Its a mood changer. Its sunshine in a jar, its that feeling you get when you take that first sip of coffee with vanilla creamer. Its refreshing, bursting with berry flavor. It is simply pure goodness one spoonful at a time."
37_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"In my opinion, the tart flavor was overcompensated by way too much sugar. I bought this with intentions of eating it on a cone with fruit/granola but its too sweet. This may be a good addition to a smoothie or homemade popsicles, but (IMO) is disgusting plain."
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is a sorbet that I cant keep from coming back to! It goes a little something like this: Ill take about 5 bites....put it back in the freezer....and about 10 minutes later Im back in there, eating it! Best sorbet Ive ever put in my mouth!"
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"What a treat! I was looking for a non-dairy dessert that would taste light, sweet and slightly tart. They hit it out of the park with this flavor! Raspberry and lemon are the perfect combination. Replaced the heaviness of an ice cream for me."
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is the BEST ever and I am not exaggerating. Its so flavorful with the perfect balence of tart and sweet. No other raspberry sorbet on the market compares (believe me Ive tried them all). My only issue is that its hard for me to find :(
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I received a voxbox coupon to try a pint for free. I choose the raspberry sorbet and the flavor is Awesome! It only has 6 ingredients and I know what they all are! This is an honest review of a great tasting product. Love the raspberry sorbet
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Im from an area where raspberries grow wild (we had bushed in our backyard), and I have to say, this sorbet taste just like a handful of fresh berries. Bright and bold flavor, and the texture is nice and creamy. You dont miss the milk :)"
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This sorbet is my favorite summertime treat. Not only does it taste delicious, but it has 4g fiber AND a fraction of the calories of typical ice cream. Furthermore, you can reuse the container as strong and sturdy tupperware. Huge fan!"
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Great flavor!!! If this came in a bigger size I would get it every time I grocery shop! It is a little expensive to get a pint for everyone. I have resorted to ordering online because I havent been able to find it in my town anymore.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The raspberry flavor was exactly like the sour yet sweet flavor of a real raspberry. So happy that it wasnt another super sugary very artificial berry flavor. Its smooth and light but still has such a great rich and pure flavor.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is one of the most delicious sorbets Ive ever tasted. If you love raspberries, it literally just tastes like eating frozen raspberries with a pop of extra flavor. Very natural and tasty. Will definitely get it again."
37_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,Great product for a sour lover as myself that also loves ice cream but has issues with dairy products. This is the best. I would love to see more sour flavors added to the sorbetto mix. Lemon would be great also.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This raspy sorbetto is delicious. It is perfect on a warm summer evening. When I can force myself not to eat the entire pint at one sitting, I love the convenience of the screw on lid."
37_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,This is the best sorbetto. Its so good I buy 4 at a time because its always sold out. I am on a salt restricted diet so I can hardly find anything good without lots of sodium in it. Thank you so much for sharing your feedback! Were so happy to hear you think so highly of Roman Raspberry Sorbetto. You can always use the store locator on our website to find other locations carrying this sorbetto in your area.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This is my favorite flavor! I can’t get enough of it. It honestly brings me joy after a long hard day. I go through a container a week then reuse them for treats at work.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This amazing sorbetto tastes like the best, freshest ripe raspberries, frozen and blended. So, so good, and excellent with some dark chocolate!"
37_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,This is one of my favorite flavors! I tasted so amazing but make sure to only eat a little each night because the flavor starts to wear off
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor tasted just like a bowl of fresh cold raspberries!!! It is so yummy and my only con is that the jars aren’t larger!!!
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The best sorbetto Ive ever had! Its perfect! I need a whole gallon. Seriously, it is amazing! 10/10 would recommend"
37_talenti,4,2.0,1.0,"I really like this flavor, however it has a weird aftertaste, so I eat it with the chocolate."
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Best fruit sorbetto hands down..awsome delectable flavors!! I want to try them all!
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,This stuff is honestly god sent & i get so sad when my local stores are out of it
37_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,This is the best thing ever! Now my new favorite!!
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Excellent flavor. Do yourself a favor and try some.
37_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,A delicious treat for all ages / the entire family!
38_talenti,4,6.0,0.0,I’m always browsing my grocery store’s ice cream section to see if they’ve brought in new flavors of Talenti and finally came across their Talenti Gelato Layers. I ate the whole jar in one sitting! I just wish there was more Dulce de Leche.
38_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,Tried the salted caramel truffles...omg so delishious. Will defenitely try all the flavors
38_talenti,5,58.0,1.0,"Be careful with this one! Its so delicious, one pint is usually not enough...ok, at least not for me, anyway. I have eaten a pint and before I knew it, I had completely finished it. At 370 calories per 1/4 cup, yeah, no....I cant partake in this sumptuous, delectable delight too often. The flavors and layers marry perfectly! Its a match made in gelato heaven but will shoot your diet to heck! LOL It is certainly wonderful! NEVER STOP MAKING THIS ONE!"
38_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"I first tried this layers flavor in May 2019 and was very impressed. Fast forward to August and it seems a lot of the ingredients are lacking. As you can see from the picture, the middle of the container has very little, if any, of the cookies, dulce de leche, or truffles. Those ingredients are mainly distributed around the edges for good presentation. Talenti, please bring back true layers. Thanks! Thanks for sharing a review of our Talenti Layers Salted Caramel Truffle Gelato! Were disappointed to learn that you received our product in this condition. Please reach out to us directly via email at consumer.services@unilever.com, as our Consumer Services team would like a chance to hear more about your experience with our gelato. We look forward to your message!"
38_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"I can’t belive we’ve eaten so many of these. We blame Talenti and all the ice cream sales at our local stores. I wasn’t much of an ice cream person until I had this flavor. My husband on the other hand... This flavor is sooo good. I hope Talenti will pair this salted caramel with cheesecake, duche de leche and the graham cracker crumbles - no chocolate. That would be soooooo amazing. I know because I’ve eaten the salted caramel and the black raspberry cheesecake together. I’m not ashamed."
38_talenti,5,9.0,1.0,"I wouldn’t just recommend this to a friend but to anyone who needs to hide away from reality for a short amount of time to enjoy life without negativity surrounding. It’s just you and your non judgmental Gelato. Boss, spouse or kids giving you a fit? This is the perfect solution to help cool you off as you hide in a undisclosed location. My only warning is how addicting it is and if you don’t like to share, hide it in a vegetable freezer bag."
38_talenti,3,7.0,6.0,I loved everything except the vanilla for some reason
38_talenti,1,7.0,0.0,Disappointed the layers only run along the outer edge of the ice cream as an attempt to create the illusion youre getting something that in fact youre not. Its just a container of ice cream.
38_talenti,3,39.0,23.0,"Love the idea of gelato with toppings. My dream come true! However, eating through it the first few layers are great with the first layer of gelato and the cookies and dulce de leche, but then you hit the vanilla and it’s like, meh. And you have to get through the vanilla to get to the other toppings! To make it better, add more dulce de leche and cookies to mix in with vanilla, or make the next layer of gelato a good flavor."
38_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,Love the layers concept!! It’s such a fun new twist on the gelato that I already loved.
38_talenti,1,9.0,2.0,The gelato layers ice cream was not actually layered. The layers were visible only on the outside. The middle (90 percent of the container) has only ice cream and none of the layered ingredients stated on the container. We appreciate you taking the time to write us - were sorry to hear of your experience with our layers. Wed like to gather some additional information so feel free to email us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com.
38_talenti,5,6.0,1.0,"What’s not to like, gelato later good, cookie layer good"
38_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"So delicious!! I know its more than one serving but I cant help it. I eat the whole container in one sitting!!! Leave it on the counter for a few minutes to soften and its even better, rich creamy and the best!!"
38_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,This product is so good!! The product flavors all go really well togeather and little carmel chocolates are the best!
38_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I loved Talenti before but I saw this at my store and had to try it, it was one of the most delicious things I’ve ever tasted and everything goes together so perfectly. I suggest instead of eating it layer by layer like some other people, take your spoon and dig it all the way to the bottom, to get every layer and experience a beautiful combination!"
38_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"Being a huge Talenti fan, I saw this ad and knew I had to try it. The layers add so much flavor and texture, it is like a gourmet dessert. In the future, I’d like to possibly see a low-calorie or dairy-free version of this same treat."
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This was the first flavor I tried of the Talenti Layers line. I was not disappointed. I could’ve easily eaten the whole pint at once so had to really demonstrate some restraint and only take a few spoonfuls at a time. The combo of flavors is perfect! The only thing is that it’s definitely preferable to get each component on the spoon for each bite but this is a little difficult to do with the layered format. However, where there’s a will, there’s a way!"
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Fantastico, Talenti! Keep up the great work! Reading some reviews, I feel like some people didn’t get the full experience because they ate layer by layer; complaining about the lack of variety in different layers. That’s so strange. Scoop it straight down! Mix some up a little- have it all together- eat each flavor individually- have some fun. This was nothing short of a masterpiece. Great flavor combinations and lovely different textures. 5 stars"
38_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"This is by far the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. Unbelievable, literally my wife and I could not stop eating it. The only I didnt like was that our local grocery store was closed. Ill be there before them to buy this stuff"
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The Salted Caramel Truffle is PERFECTION. I understand the complaints a bit about the vanilla layer but those yummy candy bits make a world of difference to it. Every layer is decadent and marries well with each other. The only issues is if you don’t own any long spoons it may be a bit harder to enjoy all the layers together. Very minute problem which doesn’t dampen the experience. I keep a few in my freezer at a time now. Five stars!
38_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,The best ice cream you can ever eat sure hope I can try it again thank you
38_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This is probably my favorite ice cream ever. The crunch is beautiful and the dulce de leche. NOT TO MENTION THE CHOCOLATES ON THE BOTTOM. WOW.
38_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,Great amount of truffle and the sea salt flavor is awesome!
38_talenti,4,3.0,1.0,Theres enough salted caramel flavor to it! Its definitely not too sweeter salty. Perfect!
38_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,"See now, I’ve been obsessed with Talenti since before the hype so i’ve tried all flavors. The sea salt caramel one was the first one I tried and was hooked!!! This right here is like a reboot of greatness, like they’re starting over. I love the cookie crumbs then the dulce syrup, then omg the truffles.. i’m so happy. Thank you!"
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ish is the business! I’m hooked after the Salted Caramel layered one... the gelato is like fluffy ice cream, and a half of a container is almost too much, and so it’s rare for the serving size to match the desired amount, but it’s so yummy and rich it’s perfect. Those little truffles at the bottom are the bomb!"
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This stuff is amazing! My only complaint is that it is super hard to get all of the layers into one bite. I bought it on a whim in the grocery store, forgot it in my freezer for a few days, and then fell in love when I finally opened it. Would recommend!"
38_talenti,5,3.0,2.0,Taste really good. I like the two flavors in the same pint.
38_talenti,4,3.0,2.0,"Taste delicious! It has texture, and comes in layers!"
38_talenti,5,3.0,2.0,Just great just great simply the best Love love love
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Love the multiple layers of flavors and crunch in this new line of flavors.
38_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I love the layers in this ice cream! Absolutely one of my new favorites!
39_talenti,5,67.0,1.0,"The gates of heaven have opened & have poured itself into a jar of Talenti Sea Salt Caramel Gelato. It is so smooth & creamy with delicious little surprises of chocolate covered caramel truffles floating throughout. I have tasted several salted caramel frozen desserts & they just have ribbons of caramel in a vanilla base. Not saying that is bad, but Talenti goes the extra mile to make the actual base caramel flavored with the perfect hint of sea salt. Absolutely a divine experience for your senses! When this goes on sale for BOGO, we buy extras. I have considered a second freezer. LOL"
39_talenti,5,8.0,0.0,"Im still salivating over the thoughts of this delicious creation, the geniuses at Talenti have done it again! I unwrapped this carton not knowing what to expect... BAM! On the very first spoonful I got a nice heaping of caramel and sea salt flavors, absolute divinity. Did I stop there? no. BAM! BAM! 2 more spoonfuls and I realize this is it... a few minutes late the carton was gone. Totally worth it. I absolutely LOVE the inclusion of the sea salt caramel truffles, the do a great job to break up the silky smooth texture. Who needs a social life when Talenti consistently produced 473mls of pure, unrestricted pleasure. I will be a costumer for life. Go Talenti Go! Keep producing these amazing creations."
39_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,The first time that I had you all sea salt caramel gelato I was on vacation spending time with family members that I havent seen in awhile and let me tell you this ice cream is amazing let me tell you I cannot just eat one or two or three fights before I know it I have finished the whole entire sea salt caramel gelato. You all should make a strawberry cheesecake and graham cracker pie ice cream I think that it would be amazing oh and by the way you guys keep up the good work cant wait to try your other flavors goodbye for now thanks for the ice cream
39_talenti,1,18.0,11.0,"I have been buying this Salted Carmel talenti gelato for over a year with no issues & love it. I am very careful about reading the ingredients as I am celiac & also must stay away from HFCS and corn syrup. I started having a few issues recently,  and I when reading the ingredient list on my most recent container, it listed corn syrup! When did this change? I wash these containers and keep them for other uses, so went back and read the ingredients on the older containers and they did not contain corn syrup as a sweetener. Sooo disappointed as I can no longer enjoy this flavor.  Hi there! We recently updated our dulce de leche formula to remove soybean oil, and to maintain the same texture and taste, a bit of corn syrup was added to the recipe. Please note, this is not high fructose corn syrup, as we are against using this ingredient and do not add that to any of our products."
39_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"I’ve bought several containers of the Sea Salt Caramel in the past, but recently we’ve been buying the Magnum bars. Last Friday, Safeway had the premium brands all on sale, so we bought the Double Dark Chocolate and the Caramel. The Chocolate was just OK, boot as dark as I remember, but tasty. The Sea Salt Caramel however was a huge disappointment, not only was the texture wrong, there was exactly 2 “truffles” in the entire pint. I just read some of the other reviews and it seems that my pint was not a unique situation. No excuse for this poor example of quality control."
39_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,i am almost sure that nobody loves anything as much as i love sea salt caramel gelato. the best experiences of my life were all when i ate this gelato. nothing beats it. everything about this product is absolutely perfect. the rich caramel taste. the creamy texture. the chocolate covered caramel truffles buried throughout the gelato. the gentle flavor of sea salt. my life didnt truly start until i took a bite out of this thing. a sincere thank you to the staff member(s) that invented this product.
39_talenti,2,4.0,0.0,Disappointment in noticing the delicious caramel bits have been reduced to virtually zero. What a drop in taste and sensation! Were sorry to hear that your Sea Salt Caramel was missing the best part - the truffles! If you reach out to our customer service team they can help you out! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us
39_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,Decided on gelato instead of ice cream and glad I grabbed this one! Its amazing! My work has salted caramel ice cream but this is so much better. Not quite enough saltiness though
39_talenti,5,5.0,1.0,I finished this in 2 days! At some at night and the rest in the morning! Its that good!
39_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I was craving a seal salt caramel creme brulee I tried months ago at work, but it was not available online (only in huge orders), so I googled sea salt caramel desserts and this product came up. I found it at Foodland and tried it...it is so silky and the flavors are so amazing...not sickly sweet like some caramel desserts I have tried. I couldnt stop eating it. I want to try all the different flavors now:)"
39_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Addictive. I am a caramel lover so that makes the flavor easy to like. It is creamy, smooth and full of flavor. A few reviewers want more ""goodies"", but this stuff is so good it can thrive even without them. I do suppose the ""goodies"" keep you eating more...you eat from goodie to goodie. I think this is the best I have had, but cant wait to try some more flavors!"
39_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Sea salt caramel gelato is AMAZING I will never go back to the basics lol I swear I always get screamed at because I tend to buy 5 every purchase Overall I got my mom addicted to talenti gelato but her favorite its medeteranian pistachio
39_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,ICe cream tastes good but was upset about the amount of truffles. I counted 4. I picked this ice cream because I wanted something chocolaty and was sorely disappointed. Last time it was better did you change the amount of chocolate?
39_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"WHERE ARE THE CARAMELS?! SO UPSET. ...but seriously, if these have been removed, this is the worst thing thats ever happened and also the end of the world."
39_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I just tried this flavor for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It is my absolute favorite!
39_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,The Salted Caramel is one of the best Gelato I have tasted.
40_talenti,5,7.0,1.0,"Got it on sale at Sprouts as BOGO. I really wanted the chocolate, so this was a bit of a consolation prize. I gore up in the South and remember butter pecan very well. Seldom see it here on west coast. Talent I is amazing but my expectationsfor this were low. Holy cow I LOVED it! Buttery, soft, smooth, sweet, creamy with lovely pecans. Its BETTER than I remember that flavor as a kid. I had 2 portions and forgot th chocolate because this is so amazing!!! Its more of a dulce de leche meets Southern pecan in a Gelato, and they fell in love, kind of flavor. Fabulous!"
40_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,"I received a coupon for a free pint from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I could not find the flavors listed so I tried this one. I’m glad I did. From the first bite, I was hooked! It is so creamy and yummy! It has an amazing flavor. It’s very good without being too overbearingly rich. Great texture! I will be trying more flavors!"
40_talenti,4,6.0,1.0,"This flavor seems to be a love it or leave it type, and my husband & I are both firmly in the *love it* camp. Its different for each of us, though, likely because our taste buds arent the same. I get a lot more flavor notes than he does- especially the butter & nut flavors- but he loves the brown sugar flavor & caramel so it works out great for him, too. Like another reviewer weve improved it with salty elements so I think itd work better for more folks with a bit more salt & vanilla, plus more nut pieces or pecan meal added, so every bite has a bit more true pecan flavor."
40_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,Me and my family recently tried this gelato and we were pleasantly please. It didnt contain very much sugar so my kids didnt go crazy after trying it. We were upset when we reach the bottom of the container but that is a plus! I received this product coupon free for testing from influenster.
40_talenti,5,13.0,7.0,The best thing i ever ate and when i get off work tomorrow i going back to the story and buy more !!!!!!!!!!!!
40_talenti,5,22.0,1.0,Very rich & makes you wants more. Every scoop you get something knew like the caramel or the tasty pecans. I am in love with this flavor
40_talenti,5,13.0,1.0,"Since I cant find my favorite flavor, I tried this one. HUGE mistake for my waist line because it is DELICIOUS! Like I will stab you with a spoon if you touch my Talenti SBP delicious."
40_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I never was a big fan of butter pecan icecream but this one I have also tried cookie carmel crunch which i love my im also looking foward to tasting the coffee brew also wen ever I find it. Thanks talenti I have my whole family hooked
40_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"This was okay and it scratched my itch for something sweet and nutty. Next time Ill pick up butter pecan ice cream. No buttery flavor to be found in this pint at all, but some nice, big pecan pieces, though. As another reviewer stated, this is now made with cottonseed oil, so the ingredient list needs to be corrected. My question is...how can you call something ""butter pecan"" when there is not a speck of butter in it?"
40_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is one of my favorite ice creams! I had never even heard of it until my neighbor had me try it. I have to say I am sooo addicted to Talenti Gelato it is insane! I have a few others that I like but this one is the best. If you love a smooth, creamy, and flavorful gelato than this is the one for you, hands down! It has just the right amount of creamy ness, and pecans to hit your taste buds just right. Be careful though as this little pint can be eaten in one sitting. I love other flavors but this is my favorite."
40_talenti,5,7.0,2.0,I love butter pecan period but this just took it to a whole different level!!! Every bit was filled with pecans and it was just so smooth!!! Im probably gonna buy all the ones from my job!!!
40_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,Hands down the best ice cream Ive ever had. Perfect balance of ingredients that all blend together perfectly. Wish it was a little less expensive so I could buy it more often.
40_talenti,1,2.0,0.0,"ingredients used to include brown sugar and caramel. Now I see skim milk, cottonseed oil, vanilla extract (used to be just vanilla) and corn syrup. I dont see caramel listed either."
40_talenti,2,2.0,0.0,Nice natural-ish flavor but too sweet. It tastes like fake butter & brown sugar stirred into milk & frozen. Not enough pecans.
40_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This is the best I have had in Talenti Gelato!!!!!
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I LOVE Talenti but this Southern Butterpecan flavor is in dire need of being reworked. The flavor was not butter pecan but more so butterscotch/maple with an artificial sweetener after taste. There were very few pecans- maybe a handful. Very disappointing and not deserving of a Talenti name!
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I did not like the taste of it and that’s my fault Bc I thought it was just butter pecan but I saw that the swirls were dulce de leche I Felt disgusted Because I don’t like that
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I thought there was a mix up with my pint of ice cream because the label lists pecans but there wasnt a single one in my gelato... but based on other reviews this is common.
40_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Rich, buttery pecans paired perfectly with creamy, smooth ice cream. I finished it in two days!! Not cool on my waist line but made my mouth and heart very happy :)"
40_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love this one I was a little hesitant at first mainly because I didnt like butter pecan but after eating this flavor all I can say is YUM!
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,I took one bite and and ended up throwing it out. The butter flavor is wayyy too strong. Like frozen butter with a little bit of sweetness thrown in.
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,This ice cream was my favorite until today! It now contains corn syrup instead of pure cane sugar. I wont be purchasing this anymore...yuck!
40_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,This use to be my favorite flavor but it seems that youve cut back on the pecans so I no longer buy this product! =(
40_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I love love southern butter pecan it’s my number one guilty pleasure and my go too when I need something sweet
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Its now made with cottonseed oil instead of soybean, and no longer is made with brown sugar or caramel."
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,Tastes like a butterscotch candy. Sadly i was really disappointed to see/taste no pecans in the mix.
40_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,This flavor has a strange taste. Not like traditional butter pecan.
41_talenti,5,19.0,2.0,"Im obsessed with this flavor! Its perfection. Im not kidding. Luckily, I found this at my local store (still looking for the Coconut Chocolate Cookie) I went back and bought another pint the next day. This reminds me of Taylor Street in Chicago when my mom used to take me and my sister to get Italian ice. The taste is so fresh. Theres another brand that is purely dairy-free and they were my go to for non-dairy desserts. Not anymore. Talenti has showed up. Trust me and treat yourself."
41_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,"I was super excited to try this flavor. With the warm summer weather upon us it sounded perfect. Initially I found the sorbet to be refreshing and bursting with strawberry flavor. The hibiscus swirl, however, ruined it for me. Although the flavor was good, it left a fine sand-like substance in my mouth. I tried several spoonfuls, some of just the sorbet alone and some including the swirl, and found the off putting texture only present in the swirl. I have enjoyed literally every flavor of Talenti that I’ve tried over years, so this was pretty disappointing. Were disappointed to hear that you didnt have a great experience with our Talenti Dairy-Free Strawberry Hibiscus Sorbetto. We would like to gather some additional information so we can better assist. Please contact us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com."
41_talenti,5,6.0,1.0,Seriously tastes like a strawberry daiquiri was poured into a Talenti cup. Refreshing and tasty!
41_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,I was so excited to see this on the shelf! I paired it with vanilla bean and Im addicted. Everyone who likes strawberry sorbet needs to try this talenti flavor!
41_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,I was so surprised at how delicious this new flavor is. Its light sweetness is amazing. I will definitely buy again. Great for someone who does not like too sweet and also for someone who has a sweet tooth. Its the perfect balance.
41_talenti,5,6.0,2.0,This ice cream is none dairy and is very good if you are lactose intolerant.
41_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,creamy like ice cream yet refreshing like sorbet. outstanding!
41_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,This flavor is delicious. Opened and emptied on the same day.
41_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"This is one of my favorite dairy-free treats! The strawberry tastes like real strawberries rather than artificial strawberry flavor, which I think is a huge plus. The hibiscus puts it over the edge though; it’s wonderful! The only reason I’m rating this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hibiscus isn’t very evenly distributed. I’d prefer a more even bite. But overall, delicious!!"
41_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,"The Strawberry Hibiscus, is a wonderfully fresh, light and refreshing cold treat!"
41_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,Strawberry Hibiscus is so smooth sweet and very rewarding.
42_talenti,2,10.0,0.0,"I got this flavor because I was excited for the hints of blueberry, but there is basically no blueberry inside! The vanilla ice cream tastes lovely, but that is all there is!"
42_talenti,1,7.0,2.0,I was bummed while eating this because there was no blueberries! They crumble part was okay but did not have much flavor other than that. Very disappointed
42_talenti,3,2.0,0.0,"This is the first time I purchased Talenti ice cream. I wanted to buy mango or mint flavor but didnt see them in the store. I was surprised to see this Vanilla Blueberry Crumble because my favorite was Haagen-Dazs Blueberry Cheesecake ice cream and I couldnt find it anywhere since summer 2012. This is actually not bad but we dont like the crumble texture at all. If I give 5 stars to Haagen-Dazs Blueberry Cheesecake ice cream, I could give only 2 or 3 stars to Talenti Vanilla Blueberry Crumble. I may buy this again only when I miss blueberry ice cream."
42_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The most underrated flavor of all the gelato!! I first bought it around a year ago, just to switch it up from my original Sea Salt Caramel. I honestly thought that it wouldn’t measure up, but as sure as all get out, it did!! Just like the caramel, I eat the Vanilla Blueberry Crumble religiously!! The blueberry sauce balances out with the vanilla perfectly, and I am a crumble girl to the core, so to add the crumbles, just made the whole thing come together perfectly!!! A lot of people don’t give it enough of the credit it deserves!!! It is so delicious, so smooth, and extremely rich!!!"
42_talenti,3,1.0,0.0,"All of the blueberry swirl seemed to be on the outside. A bit deceiving. Most of it was vanilla. The crumble pieces were delicious, but other than that there wasnt much flavor. If I wanted vanilla, wouldve bought that."
42_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,I love Talenti and they will continue to be my go to gelato. But this was highly disappointing and I’d hope they would fix this! Literally no blueberry anything.
42_talenti,1,4.0,2.0,"I expected this to be packed with blueberries and have a sort of blueberry cobbler/crumble flavor but it has absolutely no flavor at all!!! I also found the pieces of ""crumble"" to be entirely too hard, waxy and flavorless. I bought one for me & one for my husband. He said the same thing. What a disappointment & waste of money. I wont be purchasing this flavor again."
42_talenti,1,4.0,2.0,"My boyfriend and I purchased two containers of this gelato with high expectations only to be sorely disappointed. There is hardly any blueberry in this at all, and it just tastes like vanilla ice cream with random bites of ""crumble."""
42_talenti,2,3.0,1.0,"I had high hopes for this flavor, but it left much to be desired. I would have loved to taste more blueberries and my pint hardly had any crumble chunks! This flavor has potential, but I think it missed the mark for me."
42_talenti,3,3.0,1.0,"My husband brought this to me tonight. There was no blueberry sauce or blueberries in my pint. The vanilla gelato and the oat crumbles were great, but I really missed the blueberries. Oh no! Were sorry about that! Please reach out to our consumer services team so that we can fix this for you! https://www.talentigelato.com/contact-us"
42_talenti,1,1.0,0.0,"Was excited to try this flavor for the first time, but by the end of the pint was so disappointed to find not even one blueberry, or any trace of blueberries for that matter. The vanilla gelato was very good, but pretty much all of the reviewers before me nailed it. Absolutely no blueberry. Definitely going for a different flavor next time."
42_talenti,4,1.0,0.0,"I like this one a lot, I just think it would be cool if it might have had a couple of blueberries tossed in or maybe a little more blueberry swirl maybe I just picked one out that didnt have a lot of blueberry swirl I dont know"
42_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Love everything about this flavor from the creamy sweet vanilla to the crunchy pieces of crumble throughout the pint
42_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,Literally obsessed with this!! Its best flavor ever!! I want this to be my wedding cake flavor!!
42_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,One of my favorites! Love the blueberry and the vanilla together.
43_talenti,3,16.0,1.0,Just tried the Vanila Caramel Swirl for the first time. Its a good thing that I also love the vanilla because there were no swirls in the jar I got! There were just a few little specks of Caramal on the bottom of the jar; the rest was just vanilla.
43_talenti,3,7.0,2.0,"I love so many of the Talenti gelatos, and since I love vanilla and caramel, decided to try the Vanilla Caramel Swirl. Im giving it 3 stars because there isnt nearly enough caramel in this blend. Try again, Talenti. You can do it!"
43_talenti,1,7.0,2.0,Not as creamy as the others I have tried needs way more carmal
43_talenti,5,4.0,1.0,"Yoooooo this is out of this world! I just got this thing yesterday and im already almost done, can you believe that! Its creamy, delicious, and makes me think ""Dang I should probably get more"". This is so lit that Im going to get more an other day!"
43_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this flavor! I’ve tried several other Talenti flavors as I’m new to this brand. I always come back to this flavor. The amount of caramel can vary from pint to pint but even still, this is a delicious treat!"
43_talenti,1,3.0,1.0,"This had virtually no caramel! Which is a real shame because the little bit of caramel it had was delicious. But the ones in my store looked nothing like the picture on the website in terms of vanilla-to-caramel proportions. Talenti, I love you, but you could do better on this one. Thanks for your post, and were so sorry you are disappointed with your recent purchase. Wed like to gather some details about the experience so we can take a look. Please reach out to Consumer Services at consumer.services@unilever.com for further assistance - we look forward to hearing from you!"
43_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Please dont ever take this flavor away!!! This was the very first flavor i tried of course because both vanilla and caramel my favorite. looking into trying more.
43_talenti,5,2.0,1.0,This a very delicious classic because vanilla and caramel are two of the best flavors I love
43_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my go to flavor, I love it. I can eat the whole pint in one sitting."
44_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,The gooey delicious layers of gelato just melt in your mouth.This will be my 4th time trying this flavor from Talenti and mine has had layers across every time. This has quickly become a consistent go-to for me when I want something sweet. Yes I finish the entire 10.7 oz container as well... every time! Isn’t that the intention though?
44_talenti,3,52.0,6.0,"I was super disappointed in this version on talenti. The layers look really cool but when you get into it its a huge let down. First of all its hard to get all the layers at once. But thats not that big of a deal. the big deal is the deception. The fudge and cookie crunch is only on the outer edge and doesnt go all the way across. So when you get to the middle its just chocolate and vanilla gelato. No fudge. No crunch. I should have looked at the bottom of the jar before I bought it. I also bought the salted caramel one but havent tried it yet. Im curious to see if it has the same issue Thanks for reaching out. We would love the chance to speak with you further regarding your experience, and invite you to contact us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com."
44_talenti,5,7.0,0.0,"I saw this Gelato advertised on Facebook and ask my boyfriend to go get me some he came back with four flavors this was one of them and I have to admit it is extremely sweet but in such a good way.... if you like chocolate ice cream, marshmallow texture, gooey fudge and Crunch at the bottom then this is for you its the best Ive tasted!!"
44_talenti,1,2.0,1.0,The layers don’t go all the way through the ice cream they are just on the outside so basically it was just gelato and no fillings which was very disappointing.
44_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,A life long ice cream lover I have tried all types of ice cream with and without all kinds of add ins and toppings and in just about every vessel you could think of. From a standard cone to a homemade brownie waffle drenched in ice cream and chocolate syrup. You’d think at this point I’ve tried it all and May even be bored from experiencing ice cream on so many levels. NOPE! The Talenti Vanilla Fudge Cookie is an amazing ice cream! From the very top layer all the way down to the bottom! The combination of each layer is like nothing I’ve ever had! It is amazing and will satisfy vanilla and chocolate lovers alike! Try it! You won’t be disappointed!!!!
44_talenti,1,10.0,0.0,"There was no fudge layer in the container that I purchased. The website and label state that there is a fudge sauce layer and I did not have one. There is also only cookie on the outsides of the gelato and they don’t create a full layer. Were so sorry to hear of your experience with our Vanilla Fudge Cookie Layers, and we want to thank you for letting us know. Our layers are measured by weight as opposed to volume to ensure each jar contains the same amount of any individual ingredient, however it is unusual a jar would be missing a component entirely. Wed like to gather some additional details to further understand what happened - Please reach out to us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com, we look forward to hearing from you soon!"
44_talenti,2,10.0,4.0,"I recently saw Talenti gelato layers on a commercial. As a fellow lover of gelato, I was very excited to try this product. I have tried for the past hour however, along with three other people, a knife, and some scissors, to open the lid to get to the sweet gelato. As I am still successful, I have not been able to try this product. I am sure it is as amazing as it looks, but the lid and packaging should really be looked at by the company! Not only is it quite a disappointment to not be able to eat a product you buy, but it seems this problem is not just me. I have found several articles, blogs, and twitter threads that address this similar problem. Please look into this!"
44_talenti,5,17.0,2.0,"Perfect balance and combination of smooth Talenti you’ve come to love, crunchy cookie bits, and thick chocolate fudge. An updated version of a hot fudge sundae from childhood."
44_talenti,2,8.0,2.0,"There really werent any layers. They are poured in such a way to make it look like it has layers but when you actually get into it, there are no layers. A layer is something that covers a surface -- these didnt even go all the way across. Also, I dont expect it too look like the advertised image BUT these ""layers"" were so thin, they were practically nonexistent. It tasted like disappointment -- no fudge and no crunch. Thank you for contacting us about our awesome new Talenti Layers! Were sad to hear that our product didnt meet your expectations. We want to hear more about your experience, so please contact us directly at consumer.services@unilever.com."
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,I had a chocolate craving and this did the trick I was try to save some for later but that didnt happen. One minute I have a full container then the next thing I know its empty. Definitely a do againer.
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"I love this gelato. It was an adventure with each spoonful as everytime I got deeper into the cup it was a new flavor mixed in or new texture. It was great I love this, I will be trying the others."
44_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,"Talent has created the most exciting flavor bursting with decadence and melting vanilla and chocolate. Oh my the world exploded when my husband and I gave vanilla fudge cookie a try. He doesn’t eat ice cream but feel in love with this one. Grab it and get it a try. It’s lite and fluffy with wonderful soft fudge adorned in the center for great balance. We tried the treat a little soft and it was fabulous. We shared this round, but next round it’s each man for his own. Talenti, Thank you for and amazing treat!"
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The PERFECT Homework Snack! Love the texture and the new ""layers"" Talenti!"
44_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,My old favorite Caramel Cookie Crunch was sold out and I saw this and decided it a try.... Oh my goodness! This has become my NEW FAVORITE!!! As I continue to dig in the spoonful got better and better! Crunch reminds me of a Carvel cake in a jar. Went back the next day to grab another!!
44_talenti,5,5.0,0.0,The talent layers line should be illegal! It is my drug of choice! Each spoonful is worth ever calorie!
44_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,So far so good with this flavor. Throughly enjoyed and cant wait to try the rest. Really liked the vanilla and waffle cone crunch part the best. Everything goes together well.
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"The jar was pretty hard to open. I had to get a blade to go under it to unscrew it but after that, everything was pretty good! The layer of cookie and fudge that I saw had the same thickness throughout the whole thing , a whole layer . I did have to dig from top to bottom the first couple of scoops before I could get all the layers at once. I actually ate the whole thing in one sitting I know thats bad on its own but pretty much tasted like I thought it would. The fudge layer almost tastes like theres cake or a brownie in the middle. Not something Id keep out to thaw and then consume beause it kinda melts quickly. Id say if you didnt want to dig from top to bottom, you might want to scoop it all out and roughly mix it like the promotional pictures."
44_talenti,3,4.0,0.0,Lid is always impossible to open. If the gelato wasn’t so great I’d give up on it.
44_talenti,5,4.0,0.0,Wow! an AMAZING symphony of flavors beautifully blended in culinary splendor.
44_talenti,5,3.0,0.0,Listen Linda. Listen Linda. I LOVE Talenti and this is pure madness in a jar. It is tough to access all of the layers at once but it’s a smart move because I finished it all in one night. It was sooooo good and tempting to repurchase.
44_talenti,3,3.0,0.0,"Its a very smooth and tasty set of chocolate layers, but the vanilla gets lost among all the chocolate. It just ended up being a more of a triple chocolate than anything else."
44_talenti,5,2.0,0.0,THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD. IVE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING MORE WONDERFUL. IVE BOUGHT 3 IN THE PAST WEEK YOU MUST TRY THIS. ITS A PARTY IN YOUR MOUTH
44_talenti,4,2.0,0.0,I love the idea but I think that it need les I cream at the top and not cookies in the middle. Like that’s the best part why y’all being stingy with the cookie
44_talenti,5,3.0,1.0,This ice cream is so delicious and I will stock up for my family.
44_talenti,2,1.0,0.0,Overall I loved the product. I would give it 5 stars but my biggest disappointment was that the 5 layers were not consistent. When I reached the middle there was just gelato. The layers were placed around but not in between (which I looked forward too since it was layers).
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive seen Talenti gelato around stores a lot, but this is the first time Ive tried it. Its literally made gelato my favorite dessert. The smooth gelato paired with soft cookies, fudge, and cookie bits are a sweet tooths heaven. Thank you, Talenti!"

44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,Their ice cream is way over priced... However I have bought 3 of the vanilla fudge cookies and Im going to continue to buy them because it is just that good. To be honest the priced of this ice cream makes me sick.
44_talenti,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream has very rich fudge, the vanilla and cookie tie the whole thing together with one of the best tasting combinations of all the other layer flavors 10/10 recommended over anyother layers combination"

0_breyers,2,81.0,3.0,"Not the long ago Breyers set itself apart from other brands by using ONLY MILK, CREAM, SUGAR, and VANILLA in its Vanilla ice cream. They went so far as to have TV commercials with children reading the ver very simple label. Now they show similar comercials stating the Breyers is made WITH those ingredients but no longer ONLY WITH. Read the label for yourself. The ice cream is still good but the longer ingrediants list ant the missing word ""ONLY"" hasnt gone unnoticed despite the attempt to gloss over the corporate decision to move away from the one distinctive characteristic that set the Breyers brand apart from the others."
0_breyers,1,94.0,2.0,"I must agree with many one-star ratings here. The main beef is the huge change in your formula/ingredients. Its always been Breyers. When I first moved to the west coast, there was no Breyers, so I did not eat ice cream for several years. Then its here ... in the past several years Ive noticed: a) it no longer stays frozen long enough to eat it; b) when it melts, it forms into a scary gummy mess. Breyers used to melt and turn back into cream and milk basically. Why on earth would you decide to take a once delicious natural treat and load it up with a boatload of nasty chemicals that have RUINED YOUR PRODUCT?"
0_breyers,2,72.0,3.0,"This natural vanilla ice cream is not nearly as good as it used to be and I dont care for it any longer. Breyers needs to remove the vegetable gum from this ice cream in order for me to purchase this again. I do not like the texture that the vegetable gum gives to the ice cream. My local Pennsylvania Turkey Hill brand ice cream offers an all natural ice cream that is so much better than this version from Breyers. They do not put any fillers in their ice cream at all!! I do not think that the quality of Breyers ice cream is bad by any means but not nearly as good as it could be if they used all natural ingredients. Breyers, start making an all natural ice cream and Ill start buying your products again. Sorry, but Im just being honest."
0_breyers,1,421.0,19.0,"Breyers natural vanilla used to be my holy Grail of ice cream. I believe I sent a laudatory email in 2003 or 2004 to specifically thank the company for their beautifully simple ingredients, and for not using stabilizers or emulsifiers since I find they give ice cream a strange mouth texture. Imagine my disappointment when Breyers changed their formula to include stabilizers and consist of half air, and offer no product line like the original. Imagine my irritation at seeing a Breyers commercial right now bragging about using real vanilla bean and their real, natural ingredients in ice cream. I came to check the ingredients list to see if I could start buying Breyers again, but you still list vegetable gum. Its been years now, but you ruined my favorite ice cream, and despite the movement to real food, you havent fixed it."
0_breyers,1,36.0,0.0,Bryers vanilla was the only ice cream I would eat. I loved the simple real ingredients and non chemical taste. However much to my dismay I had some ice cream tonight only to find that it was the equivalent to that of a Walmart generic ice cream. The ice cream is completely Flavorless too sugary and now has corn syrup and guar gum in it. . I won’t be buying this ice cream ever again!!! So much for being all natural. Who wants corn syrup in their food!
0_breyers,1,141.0,9.0,"Breyers has changed their formula (natural vanilla). There are now 11 ingredients, not 5. The 4th ingredient is CORN SYRUP and there is also the addition of the cheap trans fat hidden ingredient, monoglycerides and diglycerides. Truly a disappointment since for decades BREYERS prided themselves on Pure and Simple ingredients. I see on there website, they still are. Look at the ingredients though. I will no longer buy their products. Dr. Donna~"

Very disappointed."
0_breyers,2,22.0,0.0,"The flavor, texture and quality of Breyers Natural Vanilla has declined remarkably over the past several years. Natural Vanilla was one of my familys favorites. While still good, it is no longer great. I find myself testing other brands in search of another ice cream that is similar to what Natural Vanilla used to be. Im guessing the bean counters have worked their statistical wizardry, but it was never about price for my family."
0_breyers,1,84.0,3.0,"Have been buying Bryers for 50 years but lately the taste has changed dramatically. Too creamy and gummy. I have tried all your vanilla varieties. They melt too quickly too. The Natural Vanilla seems closest to what ice cream used to be. Do not even want to finish an opened carton of Cherry Vanila I just bought. The ""ice"" part is gone; only some sweet gummy cream sauce is left."
0_breyers,5,53.0,32.0,"After trying Bryers Natural Vanilla Ice Cream I can say that it is so smooth, creamy and natural tasting its the only Vanilla ice cream ill buy anymore. Nothing about Bryers Natural Vanilla tastes artificial. It scoops easily from the first to the very last. Not overly sweetened, it leaves a fresh, clean feeling on your tongue that will have you wanting more. Its hard to practice moderation with an ice cream as perfect as this. The packaging is easily readable so you know what youre getting. The only downside to Bryers Natural Vanilla ice cream is that it doesnt come in a bottomless size!"
0_breyers,1,45.0,2.0,"This used to be the best vanilla ice cream on the planet. Now its just inedible. I threw out an entire half gallon (CORRECTION: 1.5 quarts since the reduced the package size). This ice cream now has a chewy texture that is quite unpleasant. Ive searched high and low for a natural vanilla bean ice cream that is the way Breyers used to be and I finally found Turkey Hill Vanilla Bean. Praise the lord, Im saved."
0_breyers,1,23.0,0.0,"Breyers vanilla was once great. I remember when it would melt away on the palate, nothing but cream, milk and vanilla extract (with the vanilla bean flecks throughout). Now its artificially enhance to make it ""creamy"" with gum, etc, leaving foam and an aftertaste. Yuck! I guess like so many things, it was too good. Maybe its cheaper to produce now. Why couldnt it have been left as it was - perfect?"
0_breyers,1,35.0,0.0,"I have literally bragged to everyone and even got people to convert to the best ice cream on the planet for as long as I can remember. I loved the snowy texture of the ice cream. It made it stand apart from all the rest. Especially the mint chip and vanilla bean! Now all the vanilla ice creams taste gummy and overly sweet. The texture is weird like a froth on the top of a latte only not in a good way. The biggest difference in the products is the added corn syrup. The reason we always turned to Breyers was to avoid it, not just because our family not doing well with it but because its wayyy too sweet like its competitors. PLEASE FIX YOUR ICE CREAM!!!!! Vow to get rid of the corn syrup from all your non commercial cookie and candy ice creams and with those to not add any to the actual ice cream. Weve been loyal and we deserve our good stuff. Heres a big one PLEASE do not use peanut ingredients in things that dont have peanuts! PLEASE remove it from the Rocky Road that I used to love and enjoy!"

0_breyers,1,45.0,2.0,"I hadnt purchased Breyers ice cream in a while and had a taste for some ice cream so I picked some up. I remembered it as a high quality ice cream with a little lower butterfat than the super premium brands and a nice refreshing light pure flavor to it. When I opened the package, I noticed that the ice cream had obviously melted and re-frozen somewhere along the supply chain. It was all frozen to one side of the container, strike one. Then I scooped it out, hmmm, the texture didnt seem quite right, it was soft and marshmallow like, strike two. Then I tasted it, ugh, awful. No flavor except sweet, all air, fluffy texture. This just didnt seem right, whats the problem? Then I checked the ingredients, yep, full of gums and stabilizers and with a butterfat content so low, they cant even call it ice cream any more. If it hadnt had the Breyers name on it, I would have checked ingredients before purchase but I couldnt imagine that Unilever would take a great brand like Breyers and completely destroy it, they did, strike three. It was so bad I threw the entire package away. If you are expecting the Breyers from the past, you will be sadly disappointed."

0_breyers,1,11.0,0.0,"I grew up eating Breyers Vanilla ice cream. I loved the vanilla bean specks, the creaminess, how it took some effort to scoop out of the container, the puddle of cream left as it melted in the bowl. I havent had any in years, and wanted some for the past few weeks. Finally picked some up today at the grocery store. So disappointed! The first difference I noticed was the texture. My freezer gets really cold, and I expected to have a tough time scooping it out at first. Nope! It was like fluff. Scooped right out like marsh mellow cream. Bad sign. Then, I tasted it. I couldnt finished my bowl. Gone was the decadent texture, and the flavor changed too. Less rich somehow. Im sure Breyers has some ""market trends, cost, taste test"" answer to this, but I really dont care. You had great ice cream for decades and you ruined it. Never buying it again, unless you take out the tara gum and go back to your classic recipe."

0_breyers,2,11.0,0.0,What are the cows fed? Grass? GMO Corn? Why dont the ingredients say Vanilla? Is it actually Vanillian? (wood pulp) Is that why you can say natural ingredients? Unilever bought Ben & Jerrys and ruined them to. Now you can only eat ice cream you make yourself.

0_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,"This ""new"" flavor of vanilla completely misses the mark when it comes to a true vanilla bean flavor. I bought this flavor thinking it was the ""old"" flavor of vanilla (Natural Vanilla with vanilla bean specks.) This flavor has absolutely no hint of true vanilla. Frankly, it is horrible and not any better than any run-of-the-mill superstore-grade vanilla ice cream, except for its lack of diglycerides. Breyers, please bring back the Natural Vanilla with Vanilla Bean Specks!"
0_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"Seems when Breyers sold out to Unilever years ago the brand was heavily cheapened. Most ice cream makers have started adding gum to their product to stabilize it during shipping. Unfortunately it makes the ice cream unbearable to the tongue. Its nothing like real ice cream any more. Breyers has succumbed to industry trends rather than maintaining a quality product that we all came to love and support. I personally never minded paying a little more money for a quality product. Theyve cheapened it and shrunken the container portion, yet still charge a hefty price. The only brands I have found that still make real ice cream are Hagan Daz and Turkey Hill. And Blue Bunny Vanilla, but it comes in a plastic container. So I wont buy it."

0_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,I rarely eat ice cream these days but bought this just to have around for the occasional indulgence. Breyer’s used to be our standard way back so this was the logical choice. I tried a spoonful and was immediately turned off by how over the top sweet it was to the point it doesn’t taste like ice cream. It’s now in the sink melting so I can flush it down the toilet. Visiting your website I see you have a no added sugar version. Why add any in the first place? Very disappointed.
0_breyers,5,21.0,2.0,I had the same issue with breyers. I finally found turkey hill all natural ice cream. Don’t settle for fillers. Eat natural
0_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"The Natural Vanilla recipe change to include Tara Gum changes the texture and more importantly, the flavor in negative ways. The previous rich and creamy vanilla flavor profile now has an “off” taste that takes away the previously perceptible vanilla beans. This was previously the go-to ice cream. Now? I tried for a while but I will not be buying again and will find a better replacement without the funky gum flavor until at least the classic recipe comes back as an option."
0_breyers,1,8.0,0.0,I havent purchased this product in awhile and was so surprised today to find out that you had cheapened the ingredients. Vegetable gum and natural flavor - what a disappointment. Youve lost a customer. Now I will be looking for an alternative.
0_breyers,1,7.0,0.0,"Boy, was I surprised when I got my Bryers home only to discover it is a “frozen dairy dessert“, not even ice cream, and that the second ingredient is corn syrup. Will not be purchasing it again. Much different from what Breyers used to stand for."
0_breyers,1,11.0,0.0,"I am interested in the flavoring components used. I notice that the ingredients list does not mention vanilla beans or vanilla, only ""natural flavors"". There is a statement on the box about the characteristics of the vanilla used (which are good), and it states that all the flavors used are ""natural"", but that all leaves it pretty obvious that there are other flavoring agents besides vanilla... I have heard that a common component in ice cream nowadays are ingredients coming from non-vegetable sources, such as ground-up beetle shells. Do you also include non-vegetable sourced flavoring agents in Breyers Natural Vanilla? Regarding the review titled ""Better before"", I must agree with this reviewer. There was a day when you advertised the vanilla bean specks, and you could really see them; not so much any more. But thats not the main issue. The flavor was much better back then; Breyers was the only manufacturer with a vanilla ice cream that had good flavor, from my perspective, but not since you changed your recipe. I still like the mint chocolate chip ice cream -- it is one of my favorites -- but you lost me with the vanilla. I dont even like it on top of pie anymore, much less by itself. Then, on top of the flavor changes you made, you are gunking it up with gum. That has been very disappointing. I dont know why you thought you had to change the recipe, much less stick with the change. Coca-Cola, back in the day when they came up with their new Coke at least had the sense to go back to their classic recipe. I dont recommend your vanilla to anyone anymore. I used to recommend it all the time."

Will no longer purchase any Breyers products until they remove the garbage they now put in it."
0_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"Years ago I used to buy nothing but Breyers Natural Vanilla Bean ice cream. It was even kept in the natural food freezer, not with the other, regular ice creams. Then you started adding Tara, vegetable gum. It totally changed the homemade texture. I understand that many people prefer the creamy texture of other ice creams and allows more air to be mixed into the ice cream, making it fluffier. It also allows you to put less ice cream into the container. I noticed that this new recipe creates a lighter product (weight wise). I prefer the icy hand cranked texture. It even melts differently now. If I left it on the counter a bit too long, and it melted a bit, the melted ice cream would still be edible when it re froze. Not any more. It melted differently in your mouth even. I’m sad to say I will be hand cranking my ice cream from now on. You gave me and my family a few years of the absolute perfect ice cream!"

I dont understand why you cant just release a vanilla bean.
0_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I used to love Byers All Natural Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing could compare. Just to let you know I would take a few Ice Crystals over the gum mess you have added.

0_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,Breyers natural vanilla has been my go-to ice cream for years on account of the fact that Im allergic to basically every other brands ice cream except for a couple. Recently they stopped including vanilla bean in it or at least this last carton I bought did not have vanilla bean in it. This is a huge mistake on their part if this is a permanent change. The actual vanilla bean parts and ice cream give it a unique taste and make it way better in my opinion.
0_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I always bought the Natural Vanilla, because it was simply milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla. They did a big ad campaign around that at one point. Why would you add gum to that? They have a handful of different vanillas. Why not leave this one alone and keep the customers who wanted that? I was especially annoyed that there was not notice of it. I just looked one day for some reason. Anyway, yuck. No reason to ever buy Breyers again."
0_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,Remove the vegetable gum and list wether or not nothing is added is added to to the cream and I’ll give 5 stars. Most companies add stabilizers and smoothening agents to cream. So please state %100 pure cream so we know there is nothing added.

0_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I was shocked to see that gum is now added to the natural vanilla. I dont care if it is a vegetable based product. I read the reasoning behind adding it to the customer service responses but I am not impressed. We loved the Breyers Naturals line because it had simple ingredients and no gum. It was creamy enough without the gum and the formation of ice crystals with temperature fluctuations means it is real ice cream! Listen to your customers. Take the gum out. Maybe you are starting to use inferior ingredients to cut costs and have to add gum to compensate but are using this lame excuse to justify it in the mix. I have been eating Breyers vanilla with vanilla bean since I could eat ice cream. You slowly ruined all of my other favorite flavors like butter pecan with garbage ingredients that make my whole family sick. Now we have had to switch to Haagen Dazs or making my own. My dad can get Turkey Hill vanilla where he lives and that still has no gums.

Then I happen to remember the name change several years back so I go to Breyers.com. Imagine my disappointment reading a lot of the reviews since the change. Now I’m almost afraid to tell him to keep looking now that I know the correct name. It seems the true lovers of that old fashion, families gathered under huge oak trees and everyone taking turns to crank that old turn crank ice cream maker, kids skipping around waiting impatiently sticking their fingers in the ice to taste the salt to finally taste that impeccable creamy, sweet, with specks of something that made that white cold frozen dessert taste like heaven. That’s what the old version of Breyers Vanilla Bean ice cream tasted like to me. Old fashioned turn crank ice cream. I would dip it out as frozen scoops but stir and stir it till it became the creamy smooth specialty that always brought me those memories. Why oh why did you have to mess with something so perfect."

Before extra creamy chocolate was available, I was slightly disappointed with the intensity of chocolate in Breyers chocolate ice cream. But, AFTER extra creamy was offered, I believe the regular chocolate recipe changed--making for a much improved offering that continues to the present. I had sort of given up on Breyers chocolate until a few months ago. Id moved to another region of the USA and was ""desperate"" for some chocolate ice cream. I did not find my usual brand so I gave Breyers chocolate another try and LIKED it!! I now find that familiar generous chocolate flavor and density I recall from some time previous.

3_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,My family LOVES Breyers Ice cream. A definite hit and will be one of the first ice cream products we go for from now on
3_breyers,3,2.0,1.0,"I was excited to try the natural chocolate ice cream because I like to buy products that have a small list of ingredients that are largely natural. Unfortunately the ice cream is rather bland. You basically just taste a strong cocoa powder taste that over powers everything. Nothing bad about the ice cream, just that there is now ""mmm this is good"" moment."

3_breyers,4,2.0,1.0,Watch out for Breyers label. Not all ice cream but Frozen Dairy Dessert!
4_breyers,1,18.0,10.0,"The first time I thought it was a fluke, a bad run, not enough strawberries in the mix. But I have purchased the strawberry ice cream three or four times this summer, each time hoping a new crop of strawberries would have somehow made it into the mix, but alas the ice cream is as bland as ever. Where is the strawberry flavor? Did the price of strawberries go up so you had to use as few as possible and still qualify as ""strawberry""? And creaminess? Thats gone too. But one good thing, is that certain flavors - alas, not all - vanilla , chocolate, the disappointing strawberry, are made with only a few ingredients and contain no corn syrup."
4_breyers,5,14.0,2.0,"Ive tried many, and Breyers strawberry ice cream is the winner. Is pretty obvious this product is made with high quality and fresh ingredients. The balance between texture, flavor, and sweetness is masterful. This ice cream is the closest Ive found to the ones we make in my country, I could not be any happier to have discovered Breyers. Please never compromise your quality, I hope youre around for many many many more generations."
4_breyers,1,4.0,1.0,Second time I was dissatisfied. Thought maybe it was just a bad batch but this was ridiculous!
4_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"I havent had strawberry ice cream since I was about 10 or 12 years old and I am now 59 yrs old , I was by my cousins for the week-end last week and his wife brought me some of the Breyers Natural Strawberry and it took me back to being a kid again it was filled with flavor and so much strawberry not like other ice cream brands that is why I havent ate it since being a kid . If you want Ice Cream that is Full of FLAVOR and just all around great BUY Breyers and enjoy being taken back in time ."
4_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Many ice creams are too sweet with sugar overpowering the flavor, but not this one which is why I love it. Also, my mouth and palate feel refreshed after eating it. I highly recommend!"
5_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,"To say I’m disappointed in this ice cream is an understatement. I went to scoop myself some ice cream, and there are no chips in my mint chocolate chip! And there is almost no mint flavoring. It’s like a tub of vanilla. What gives? Not to mention the fact that these tubs are getting smaller and smaller. FYI, we do notice these things! Ridiculous!"
5_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Im glad that this ice cream hasnt been ruined with the gunk. The light feel in the mouth of this ice cream is so wonderfully refreshing, and of course the mint is part of that. Im curious about the reviewer who thinks that there be too many chips in this ice cream. I love the abundance! And the chocolate is so wonderfully chocolaty, not sweet, and its texture is wonderfully creamy its temperature not be exceedingly cold. I could agree with the reviewer who wished it wouldnt be as sweet; I think 60-80% of the sugar would make it even better. Breyers Mint chocolate chip is one of my three top ice creams of any brand."
5_breyers,4,6.0,0.0,I had the pleasure of being able to try the Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. It was a big hit at my sons birthday party! The taste was delicious after I got over it not being green. My favorite part was it not having any GMOs in it. That is what I talked the most about with family and friends. The kids loved it and couldnt believe it was mint because of it not being green. Who would have thought a color would make you think twice before trying something. I tell you though its definitely worth it. It has a nice creamy texture not overly minty and a good amount of chocolate chips in it. I would definitely buy it again and a few friends have already gotten some after trying it at the party.
5_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"This seems to be a recurring theme lately, but I recently purchased a carton of this product at my local grocery store. Last night I decided to finally dig into it and to my surprise, there were no chocolate chips in it. I decided to eat what I scooped anyway and while there was a hint of mint flavor, it wasnt very good. I will likely never purchase this product again."
5_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Loved the creamy ice cream, and flavor! It was exactly what I was craving! Love that your items are non-gmo and natural! Thank you!!!!"
5_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Brewers has the best Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream out there as far as I am concerned. The mint ice cream is creamy with just the right amount of mintiness. I could do without quite so many chocolate chips and agree with another reviewer the chip-to-ice cream ratio is a bit too much. I would love to see a mint ice cream with a ribbon of chocolate instead of the chips. I love the semi-sweet chocolate flavor but crunching the chips grind the chocolate into my teeth too much. I would prefer having the flavors both smooth in each bite. It’s still my favorite, though!"
5_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I wanted Breyers because I used to have it all the time years ago and because it listed the least amount of junk ingredients on the label compared to other brands at my grocery store. The texture was okay, and they were very generous with the chocolate chips. However, thats where it ends. The flavor was very mild mint. I did not get that nice cooling, refreshing taste. It tasted more like vanilla than mint ice cream. I even double-checked the box to be sure I did in fact purchase mint. Yep. Also, the chips were hard and not melty. I had to chew each chip instead of having them melt in my mouth. I guess I will be going back to Hood ice cream or some other brand. When I buy MINT chocolate chip ice cream, I expect it to have a strong minty flavor. Too bad, Breyers, you used to be good years ago. You have lost a customer."
5_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I have been eating Mint Chocolate chip ice cream for 37 years so I think I know what Im talking about when I say that Breyers makes the best mint chocolate chip ice cream ever! Its creamy tasting mint with chocolate chip chunks that are incredibly satisfying. It doesnt have that green fluorescent coloring and its just superb. It reminds me of an Andes after dinner mint & I love it. Beware; Its very hard not to eat the whole container in 1 sitting.
5_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"what exactly is a ""chocolate flavored"" chip? It doesnt even make any sense, if its not a chocolate chip, than what kind of chip is it? A chip isnt a thing! Please bring back the real chocolate chips and start putting better quality ingredients."
5_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite ice cream, but about 2 years ago, I noticed that it wasn’t the same anymore. The taste and consistency had changed for the worse. It was much more like the cheap store brands that my parents used to buy for me when I was little. I gave it two tries, but then switched to another brand."
5_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I was quite pleased, when I found this ice cream and that wasnt loaded with green, artificial, chemically processed dyes or flavor! The simple ingredients, going back to the good old days - when everything was produced like this, drew me in and hence, I pass along the good news to my friends & family."
5_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,I (sadly) purchase at least 2 cartons a month. We love Breyers mint ice cream. These last two purchases... there was no mint taste at all. Tastes like vanilla with chocolate chips. It may be time to switch brands after 20+ years of Breyers
5_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,Tasted NO mint whats so ever. Tasted more like sweet cream with chocolate chip pieces. Wasnt bad but I paid for mint not sweet cream
6_breyers,3,3.0,1.0,"I’ve been buying Breyer’s ice cream all my life. One of the greatest treats my mother and father could give me was buying your Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry ice-cream, but my most recent purchase of this product proved most questionable as to your standards. The “Natural Vanilla” was no more than your generic store brand vanilla with no vanilla beans. The chocolate and strawberry tasted subpar to the product you normally produce; the chocolate lacked a strong coco flavor, but still maintained a full body. The strawberry also seemed less flavorful, but also maintained its expected body. My primary grievance is the quality drop in your vanilla ice cream. You advertise Natural Vanilla but are no longer producing."
6_breyers,5,8.0,0.0,I grew up on this. My parents always kept a container of the Neopolitan in the freezer. As good as it’s always been
6_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"Ate this flavor for 15 years until I tried Edys and Turkey Hill. Many years ago I would have said that breyers is way better than Turkey hill. Sure Breyers has a more natural ingredient list, but it loses as far as consistency, taste, and added sugar. Turkey Hill tastes far better and has a few grams less sugar. Breyers Ive found the quality is inconsistent batch to batch. Other ice creams are smoother and have more taste despite using less sugar than Breyers"
7_breyers,3,4.0,0.0,"I first tried the cookies and cream which was good. So I went back and purchased 3 more pints; 2 creamy chocolate and 1 more cookies and cream. When I tried my second pint, I noticed some of the creamy chocolate ice cream had melted down and it had a gummy texture to it. I tried to salvage it by scraping the top layer off to see if it would taste better and eventually it did, but I would hate to repeat this same process on the second pint. I would like to add that it does take a while for it to get soft, so I suggest you sit it out 30 minutes before attempting to eat it. The ring around the container is where the ice cream started."
7_breyers,1,12.0,2.0,"I posted a review 2 weeks ago about my first experience about this pint of Creamy Chocolate (whole new meaning to creamy) ice cream. And if you saw my pic, the first pint had a dark ring around the container from where the ice cream started inside with horrible tasting ice crystals on top. Ok now about this pint, as you can see in this pic, the ice cream isn’t stuck to the container with the same horrible looking crystals. I have cheaper ice cream that had better quality than this. I will not attempt to eat this and I hate that I am melting my money down the drain... Somebody please refund me because this is a ridiculous mess, and I would’ve given it NO stars if there was an option to!"
7_breyers,1,9.0,0.0,This is the second pint Ive purchased. The first one was great and had wonderful flavor. This second one was dried out with ice crystals and seems to have shrunk considerably in size. Also hard as a rock with some sort of gummy coating surrounding it. Even if I let it sit out and thaw some Im not sure I want to eat it. This is something that is a splurge for me money wise due to the high cost. Im very disappointed and Im not sure I will be taking the risk again.
7_breyers,5,20.0,0.0,"Although plain chocolate ice cream is one of my least favorite ice cream flavors and I felt this pint got boring after a while, it deserves 5 stars for what it is and I think it will definitely appeal to those who do like chocolate! Like the cookies & cream pint, this flavor tastes much closer to real ice cream than Breyers other Delights flavors (mint/vanilla). No bitter taste or artificial sweetness that I could detect, just pure chocolate. I appreciated the notes of dark cocoa (rather than being only milk chocolate), but it also sort of reminded me of chocolate pudding or fudge pops. Dont get me wrong, theyre good and I enjoy them every once in a great while, but I can get a box pretty cheap and theyre not high in calories to begin with. I also feel like the texture in this pint was a little gummy compared to the others. I must say, however, Im very impressed with Breyers as this pint was filled to the rim and perhaps even a little past that! As far as Breyers Delights go, my personal ranking is: Cookies & Cream, Vanilla, Mint, then Chocolate, but I regularly eat a lot of the competitors lower calorie protein ice cream pints. I feel the more popular ranking for those not used to erythritol will be: Cookies & Cream, Chocolate, Vanilla, then Mint, since the first two are closer to real ice cream and the last two have more of an artificial sweetness prevalent. I would love to see Breyers take this chocolate base and do something more interesting with it, like peanut butter or brownie batter swirls! Or add some red food coloring, cheesecake swirls, and chocolate cake pieces for a red velvet flavor!"
7_breyers,2,11.0,5.0,"I was a bit dissapointed right off the bat when I took the lid off. The look thru me off completely, there was a big spacing inside which I dont know if thats normal or if it was old. The texture was a bit grainy looking, and the color was blotchy. Not what I envision when I think of creamy chocolate. Breyers calling is not protein ice cream thats for sure. I have tried a few protein ice creams and honestly this one is one of the worst tasting ones. It left an after taste which was not appealing at all. Needless to say I only tried a few spoonfuls and the pint ended up in the garbage."
7_breyers,5,30.0,5.0,Tastes no different from regular chocolate breyers. I dont know how if the formula is any different but its super creamy. Beats any of the Arctic zero ice cream in texture and taste. Can be hard to find but its the best <300 cal per pint Ive had yet.
7_breyers,5,9.0,0.0,"This has an excellent chocolate taste. It can get really hard and difficult to scoop, but very good-tasting. My husband tried the mint chip and liked it as well. I look forward to trying other flavors"
7_breyers,5,7.0,0.0,"The best thing about this is that there is no strange aftertaste. The chocolate is so rich and the texture is really creamy. When melted, it looks and tastes like cold brownie. Its so good. Beats Halo Top by miles. Im glad Breyers came out with this because its better and more affordable. Make more flavors!!!"
7_breyers,2,28.0,25.0,I was super excited to try Breyers Delights creamy chocolate ice cream the 20g of protein and only 270 calories is a plus. Upon opening it looked anything but creamy and tasty but gave it a try. It tasted chocolaty but I also noticed an unpleasant after taste. I would have really liked to know that it contained erythritol which is a sugar substitute before buying because for me it could cause tummy upset. We usually like and purchase Breyers natural ice cream but I was quite unsatisfied with this product from Breyers.
7_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"I bought Breyers Delights because it has fewer calories than Halotop. When I opened the carton, i was expecting it to be full to the top like the other brand, but it looked only 2/3 full and had freezer burn. What happened? It also was very hard. But when it thawed, it had a good chocolate flavor."
7_breyers,5,7.0,0.0,IMO it is very good. Nice strong chocolate taste but not as creamy as the two other brands with similar nutritional stats. Stronger chocolate taste then the other mentioned brands.
7_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"As many of the other reviews noted, when I opened the container it was only approximately 2/3rd full. The ice cream had condensed down into a hard, unattractive texture. I did taste it. The taste is acceptable...not fabulous, but good enough for reduced calorie ice cream. Upon going back to the store I checked a number of the other containers and all were the same 2/3rds or less when you squeeze on the container. Too bad. Breyers, I really wanted to like this ice cream."
7_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Pleasantly surprised that it actually tasted like regular chocolate ice cream! The only thing I was disappointed about was that when I opened the container the ice cream had shrunk away from the sides and did not appear to be a full container (as several people have already mentioned). I tried to stick my spoon it it, but it was very hard. I let it sit out for about 30 minutes, and it softened up pretty well, and even seemed creamy. I love ice cream, but am trying to cut down on calories, so I have tried several brands of light ice cream, and Breyers definitely tastes the best."
7_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"FIrst of all, I love ice cream, but am on a diet, due to medications and heredity. IF I ever want ice cream I have to pretty much have it a a meal, as it is so caloric. Anyway, I was browsing at my market and stumbled upon ""Breyers Delights."" Let me tell you, I have tried many other so-called light or diet type ice cream type products and could not even try a second time, however, with the Breyers Delights, I WAS DELIGHTED! to say the least. I was VERY, VERY sceptical that it would be any good, but, hey, I have tried all the rest, why not one more. WOW! was I surprised. The chocolate flavor one, was absolutely FANTASTIC! I am thinking about how I can stock up on it since it was on sale. Highly recommend ice cream, for those of us who love Breyers but not calories. Thank you Breyers for an Ice Cream of Delightment!"
7_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"Ive always loved Breyers ice cream due to the taste and the very few ingredients they use. Ive tried halo top and was not happy with the taste nor the texture.

7_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"This was so incredible tasting that I didnt feel the least bit guilty eating it. Ive been trying to cut down on sweets lately but had an ice cream craving and Breyers Delights hit the spot. Creamy chocolate was definitely a winner, but I cant wait to try the other flavors vanilla bean, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip!! The creamy chocolate was only 270 calories for the whole pint. I may or may not have eaten the whole pint. Ok, I did, but I dont feel bad about it."
7_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"I have tried all the low fat pints. Halo Top, Enlightened, etc. This has the best chocolate flavor and no chalky aftertaste. Just let it sit out for a few minutes before you want it eat it, it gets extremely hard in the freezer."
7_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,"I was a little skeptical of a ""light"" ice cream, I would rather eat a little of something I love than a lot of something that doesnt taste good. I was pleasantly surprised with the Breyers delights Creamy Chocolate ice cream!! If I didnt see the package and this was just given to me in a bowl, I dont think I would know its a light ice cream! I did put it in a small bowl, mostly because I want to enjoy it a few times (otherwise I would have probably eaten the whole container!!) Im looking forward to trying the other flavors!"
7_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,I just had two spoons of it and threw it in the garbage. It literally tasted like dry cocoa powder with ice.
7_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I bought a pint of the chocolate on a whim, even though I’m usually a Halo Top fan... man, am I glad I did! This ice cream is amazing!! It honestly tastes exactly like regular ice cream. It’s creamy, smooth and very chocolatly. I could not believe this was light ice cream. It’s so much better than any other light ice cream I’ve had. Not at all icy or lacking flavor. Thank you Breyers for creating this heavenly prouduct! Can’t wait to try all the the other flavors! After a taste of this, I have been converted into a loyal fan!"
7_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,"I was very unimpressed by this ice cream. It was very hard, the container wasnt completely full just like the mint flavor I tried and I think the price isnt great which Is something I looked at while at the store. Unfortunately I would t try god again."
7_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"We bought 2 pints of this ice cream at Winn Dixie, the first pint was great, soft and delicious. How ever the 2nd pint was as hard as a rock and 3/4 full. This ice cream taste like fudgecicles but a lot more expensive. We took the 2nd pint back and got another pint and it was the same exact way. We will never buy this ice cream again, I will stick to fudgecicles."
7_breyers,3,3.0,0.0,"I was really excited to try Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate because I love ice cream but Im always looking for healthier alternatives that are delicious but still offer good nutrition. The good: Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate has only 270 calories per pint, thats right, per PINT! It also has 20 grams of protein per pint, so youre not just eating empty calories. The okay: The ice cream had decent texture and taste as regular ice cream. It didnt taste too watery, and the chocolate flavor definitely came out. The bad: The aftertaste of the ice cream was very off-putting, and the pint, even though I tried it right after I got home from the grocery store (couldnt resist a taste before dinner!) was frozen solid. It was really hard to scoop, and even after I left it out for 20 minutes, I still didnt get a nice round scoop. Breyers Delight Creamy Chocolate didnt taste as creamy as I would have liked. The bottom line: Breyers Delight Creamy Chocolate is certainly a good alternative to regular ice cream, but dont expect it to taste as indulgent as a scoop of your favorite chocolate ice cream. Its great for people looking to make healthy choices, but the after taste and texture might be a bit off putting."
7_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"I dont really know how to describe this stuff... Its a solid snack. It tastes like ice cream, not low-cal ice cream. Not chalky, not icy. Its definitely not as satisfying as some of the fancy full fat stuff, but I wouldnt have thought it was healthy-ish. Will definitely be considering this for future sweet tooth cravings."
7_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,Cant hide the excitement everytime i go to the icecream isle. The breyers delights is the new released icecream and they are in pint so you could try any flavors without having to buy by gallons. I tried the creamy chicolate and it was fantastic. It was so creamy and chocolatey i cant stop from scooping. My family loves it too so will definitely buy more and try the other flavors
7_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This was the perfect way to satisfy my sweet tooth without sacrificing calories. The Breyers delights Creamy Chocolate flavor is a chocolate lovers dream. While the ice cream had a slightly different consistency compared to other ice creams, it wasnt noticeable after the initial bite. I was able to enjoy this for dessert without feeling guilty, which is the best feeling! I am excited to try the other flavors soon!"

7_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Hands down the best low calorie ice cream...coming from a lifelong chocoholic. If my memory serves me well Ive had a passion for anything chocolate since I was about 4 years old, and I particularly fancy chocolate ice cream or any ice cream with some form of chocolate in it. One would not think I am health conscious with a history like that but I work hard to find a healthy balance and weight. I have tried several other light ice creams and they all have an odd funky taste to me. Until I tried Breyers Creamy Chocolate. Its the real deal if you are looking for a full flavored rich chocolate taste with no Oddish taste. The only thing that prevents me from having this in my freezer on a regular basis is the price. Its a minimum of $5 at any store in my neighborhood and unfortunately I have not seen any coupons that are available to help offset the cost. If youre a chocolate fan or an ice cream fan do yourself a favor and try this one."
7_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Ive tried all the others and this Breyers Cream Chocolate is definitely the best. Just the right chocolate too...... not light, more of a dark chocolate.

7_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"The creamy chocolate is really good, to me it has a silky chocolate taste. Its really smooth and full of chocolate flavor. The color was great, but around the edges it looked a little darker. I really like how it smells. All around I think this was a great ice cream."
7_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"First and foremost, in my area, for some reason, its only available at a couple of pharmacy chains. Why not at Walmart or Meijer ? This means its too expensive. The price at the local Rite-Aid is $6.29 for a pint, no matter what the flavor !!! REALLY ??? I almost did not buy it, but I thought what the heck, Ill try it. Heres the result: 1. Flavor is fine, but about average. 2. Like other commenters have stated, it looks like Breyers ""preformed"" the product and then put it in the container. The ice cream doesnt even touch the edges of the container. I was actually able to turn the container over and remove the entire contents out of it. And when you open the lid, its not very visually appealing. I wont buy it again... not for the price. I can buy a whole half gallon of chocolate Breyers at Walmart or Meijer for about half the price. Sorry, Breyers, you didnt do this one right. Your distribution in my area is no good. I mean, why do I have to go to a PHARMACY to buy ice cream ? Thats ridiculous."

This is going to be awesome because of how hard it was to get to the ice cream. I finally broke the seal and found a 1/2 pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream. What a waste of $5.00 and some change. When something’s is advertised as a pint and you can clearly see room around the product and the container. There is something very wrong there. Also there was a good 3-4 inches below the rim. I’ve never eaten ice cream that was in a container that you could see to the bottom of and it was just opened... Should went with something different like I got my mom. Thankfully she shared hers!"
8_breyers,3,4.0,0.0,This ice cream is great and I love that I can eat it all. But when I opened the pint it wasn’t even full. Maybe it melted at some point and shrunk? I was sadly disappointed.
8_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,"My 2nd time trying this ""ice cream"" and 2nd time disappointed. First time the container wasnt full. I sent a message to Breyers on Facebook, but it was ignored. It was on sale this week at my local supermarket, so I tried it again - same problem. When you take off the top, there is at least 1"" of air between where the ice cream is and the top of the lid, plus a large ring around the edge of the container with just air. If you push your fingers in the bottom of the container, it completely dents in by >1"" proving there is just air in the bottom of the carton as well and not ice cream. Quality issues aside, this batch tasted horrible. It was gritty, hard as a rock, and does not resemble ice cream at all. The other flavors tasted much better and I will never buy the mint again. After fighting to get a spoonful out, it literally feels as though there is sand on your lips and tongue from the grit. Huge disappointment, and a big waste of money for the 2nd time. Will NOT be purchasing again."

I tried the Mint Chocolate Chip flavor that was only 310 calories per pint. I typically leave ice cream out on my counter for five minutes or so to let it defrost a bit before serving. After five minutes, my ice cream was still hard as a rock and required quite a bit of work to scoop some out. My initial thought after tasting it was that it was refreshing. There were lots of chocolate chips in it, but I found the mint flavoring to be too overpowering. Disappointing since I had high hopes for this ice cream."
8_breyers,1,17.0,4.0,"While I tend to love mint flavor with chocolate, this was way overpowering. But even before I could taste it I had to get it out of the carton, which was a challenge. Like another reviewer noted, it was smaller and pulled away from the carton, plus hard as a rock. I was afraid I was going to break my ice cream scoop. The only way I could get any out was by scraping the top of the ice cream to get any out, while doing this and through my frustration I poked a hole in the carton. This product reminds me of the brand Halo, I had the same problem with it too, their product didnt have any flavor. Sorry Breyers I wont be purchasing this again."
8_breyers,5,7.0,1.0,"I have been searching out low calorie high protein ice cream and had enjoyed Halo Top, until I found this!! Omg is this good!! Like to die for good! Its creamy and smooth and has the texture of a true ice cream, but without the nasty calories and has the added benefit of the protein!!! If you like mint chip you can not go wrong with this! Nice amount of chips to ice cream ratio. And not little slivers that you can hardly tell are chocolate! This was a pleasant surprise. Yummyyyyyyyy Also the price is not crazy high for what you are getting. If you are looking for a low calorie high protein ice cream you can not go wrong with this!!!"
8_breyers,4,48.0,1.0,"As someone who regularly consumed competitors low calorie protein ice cream pints, I was actually impressed with the Breyers Delights Mint Chip. To me, it tasted just like the mint released by one of the best selling low calorie protein ice cream brands rhyming with Tail-O Hot. Identical, really. That being said, I dont regularly consume mint ice cream so I let my mother try it. She eats mint flavored goodies ALL the time and has always been a fan of Breyers regular mint chocolate chip ice cream. I thought she was going to love it, but to my surprise she spit it out and rinsed out her mouth saying it had a weird bitter taste she couldnt stand... huh. In the end, I suppose it comes down to the person and their experience with these types of products. If you regularly consume foods sweetened with erythritol, youll probably love this ice cream and not get enough. If you usually consume the real stuff, you might want to stick with Breyers Delights cookies & cream pint, which is much closer to actual ice cream. Id give it five stars since I had nothing to complain about, but left it at four as a warning to those like my mother."
8_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,"Breyers ice cream has long been my favorite brand as it’s what my grandma always had for us growing up. Natural Vanilla and Mint Chocolate Chip are the two varieties I love most. I was thrilled to see Breyers created a recipe for a reduced fat, high protein treat and even more thrilled that Mint Chip was one of the flavors. My husband picked me up a pint and when I opened it up, I was disappointed to see the container wasn’t even full. I really hope that’s not why the container is only 310 Calories. I decided to give it a try and while I liked the flavor (though clearly different from the original mint flavor I love) the ice cream itself was rock hard! Even after letting it sit out for 10 minuets. I am not impressed and now that I see others have had similar experiences, I’m even more bummed that mine wasn’t just s fluke. I hope Breyers can find a solution here because this isn’t working. I did submit this complaint to customer.services@unilever.com already so we’ll see what they can offer up."
8_breyers,4,9.0,1.0,"Was excited by the green container and thought Breyers had actually tried their hand at green mint chocolate chip, but it was white. Still, for white mint chocolate chip, it was super good. Only problem I had was that, like another reviewer on here, my pint was only like 80% full. There was about a half inch ring of air around the cylinder of ice cream. If Im going to be paying $5 for a pint instead of $5 for three quarts, Id like it to be a full pint."
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Tried to call company to give them a heads up about this problem and they treated me terribly. When you open container it is merely a small hardball in the center. My guess, although I am not sure is that they whip up the ice-cream so the reduction in calories is because it is filled with air and then the air evaporates leaving a hard center. See pic. This is a newly opened container."
8_breyers,2,6.0,0.0,"First off, $5 is a bit steep for a pint of ice cream. Packed with protein or not. It was the protein the caught my attention in the first place. Im not sure if I got a bad pint or not. But the ice cream was a lot smaller than the container. I wondered if I even had a full pint of ice cream. I had a difficult time getting a spoonful. The ice cream was a solid block. I thought maybe it was my freezer temp. But other ice cream in my freezer did not freeze this hard. I got the mint chip flavor. It was definitely flavorful. Cool mint. Semi sweet chips. It was good. I certainly wouldnt call it creamy. Its frozen skim milk with mint flavor and chocolate chips that tastes good. But I dont think its with $5 a pint."
8_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,I was suprised to open the container and found that it was only 3/4 full. I’ll try It anyways but it was hard as a rock. I guess I will let it it melt or something and maybe eat it later. This just ruined my mood !
8_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"First of all, the fact that it was not even close to an actually full pint is infuriating. Could the VERY large amount of space on the top and in between the ice cream and container wall be the reason it was rock hard even after being out for a half an hour? After all of the negative feelings to start out with I thought I would at least be rewarded with great taste - WRONG. The most prominent taste was milk, the mint was there a bit but milk was really what I tasted. And those chocolate chips? The worst. Aside from feeling like I was biting pebbles the texture was gritty, not at all smooth, and there was no chocolate flavor. The chips were completely tasteless. A total waste of money that I will not bother with again."
8_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Im disappointed with how little ice cream was in the carton- I had over an inch of empty space in the top when I opened it. Im guessing this was a fluke? Anyways, I find the texture a bit too icy and the flavor was too minty for me, like an Andes mint or peppermint."
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I love Breyers ice cream and was excited to see a reduced fat ice cream. I was so confident that I would love this product I purchased 2 flavors Mint chip and the raspberry fudge swirl. Both of them were a real let down. Theyre hard as a rock ,pulled away from the sides of the container the taste of the raspberry had a waxy flavor (once it finally thawed), and at this point I doubt I will try the mint chip but I am attaching a photo of its appearance."
8_breyers,3,2.0,0.0,"1. I give the actual ice cream a 5 star. I have tried Halo Top a few times and I always get a weird flavor that goes with it. I understand why people say the mint is to powerful but I liked it and if it hides any other weird after taste thats fine by me. 2. The reason I gave 3 stars is because I did not get a full pint there was so much empty space I thought it had melted....whats going on Breyers? 3. People are saying it is like ice milk, personally I thought it had a good ice cream texture not the best. But hey its high protein lowfat ice cream its not going to be perfect!"
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"Ive been buying Breyers Ice Cream for years now and the quality isnt what it has been in the past. It appears that the machinery that puts the chocolate chips in has been re-programmed to NOT put in as many chips as have been there in the past. I thought it might just be a flook but after buying 3 ADDITIONAL containers over the past 2 months, the chocolate content just isnt there and has actually be come LESS than previous. At times when eating the product, I have found a complete shortage of chips in the container to the point its only vanilla(mint flavored) ice cream. I have called and complained twice in the past, but it seems those complaints have fallen on un-caring ears."
8_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,The flavor & texture is good for low-calorie ice cream but my pint was only about 2/3 full. For the price I expect a full pint. Quite disappointing.
8_breyers,1,7.0,4.0,Great peppermint taste but the pint was not full. This has a smooth texture as compared to Halo.
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"We have tried and enjoy the chocolate variety, that is great. But the mint chocolate chip was only partially filled when opened with gaps, and it tasted odd/poor. Like other reviewers here, something wrong with production process."
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I have purchased two pints of this product and both have been 3/4 full! I love the taste since it seems almost as good real ice cream but at $4.99 a pint I will no longer be buying it,"
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Bought this yesterday. Opened it tonight. This is what I saw.!?!?!? Umm wheres the rest?? Its rock solid and has crazy freezer burn. I would like a refund. Who do no contact?
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,There were maybe 15 chips in the whole pint. The ice cream was the conistency of marshmallow and the container had a large air pocket in it. Would not buy it again. Horrible!
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"This is the 3rd flavor that I have tried, while the taste is ok, all three pints have been half filled, absurd. This will be the last time...."

8_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"I was super excited to try this after loving their competitors versions, but this was awful. The flavor tasted like straight toothpaste. The chips were good but I couldnt eat more than a bite of it."
8_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"When I first heard of this new ice cream, I thought Id give it a try. When I picked it out of the freezer section it felt very light and the pint would give in if pressed. I brought it home and tried it the next night. The ice cream was hard as a rock and had to sit out a little while before I could get a good spoonful. Once I did, I was overwhelmed with the mint flavor, it was so strong that I couldnt eat much at a time. I might consider giving the other flavors a try, but I dont think I would try the mint again."
8_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,It was incredibly minty. It tasted like they just poured a whole bottle of mint extract into the ice cream. It felt more like I was chewing gum or brushing my teeth than eating ice cream.
8_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Usually low calorie, low fat, better for you ice cream tastes exactly how it sounds. Better for you, but not your taste buds. I was very impressed with the flavor of this ice cream. It was creamy and delicious! Other low calorie, high protein ice creams I have tried have a terrible texture and left a weird aftertaste. Most of them didn’t taste like ice cream so in the end wasn’t a satisfying treat. I’m happy that I have found an ice cream that tastes great, but is still a better option for my health."
8_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,Competitors Mint is way better. I dont think I will try more flavors in Breyers delight. I will stick with the competitor. Yuck.
8_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Regular Breyers chocolate chip mint ice cream is my favorite ice cream of all time. This low calorie version brings back memories of the real thing. Its not as creamy, which is a to be expected, and there are enough crunchy chocolate chips so you dont feel like youre eating a diet product. Recommended!"
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"If it were a healthy decision, I would eat ice cream for every meal. And, although this dessert has a waistline-pleasing calorie count, I am not sure I would purchase it again. Both my daughter and I did decide it was pretty tasty for a low-calorie ice cream, however it is a little pricey. Also, I am a little disappointed with the lack of that minty green color I appreciate. Instead, this treats color is very similar to dirty dishwater; making it less appetizing."
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream got the job done. It was late and my sweet tooth hit. I needed something sweet but I felt like it was too late for ice cream because of the calories. I went to the fridge and looked over my selections. Brewers delight Mint Chip was the winner because of the calorie count. I enjoyed the mint taste and the chocolate chips. My only complaint is that the container is not full to the top. I would definitely try this brand and flavor again.
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Container was sealed with the plastic on top. Commercial shows the cup overflowing. Once container was opened , it looked like a cube of ice cream that was about an inch below the top rim. Also had air gap at bottom the l could feel by just squeezing the container. Say one pint but it was actually about a half pint of ice cream for $5.49! What a rip off! At least when then went from selling 1/2 gallons they shrunk the package also."
8_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"I regularly eat a competitive high-protein, low-calorie ice cream brand and was interested in comparing Breyers Delights to it. I first tried the Cookies and Cream flavor, which I felt pretty favorably about. But I had the same problem as others with the mint chip. The pint was not full (it went up to the top, but there were air pockets around the sides, which explains why when I picked the container up in the store it felt soft and not fully frozen. Turns out it was rock-hard frozen, but because the container had air pockets around the ice cream, there was ""give"" where the air was when you squeezed the container). Im used to this type of ice cream needing to be slightly defrosted or tempered time before eating, but even when softened, this tasted more like ice milk that ice cream. There was no creamy texture (the cookies and cream was much better in that category). The mint flavor was sharper and more bitter than the competition. The chips were OK, not great. Overall, I definitely prefer the competitions mint chip fudge to the Breyers (it sells for the same price and on sale, I can get it for about $3.12 a pint). I might try the Breyers again it they worked on improving it."
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Breyers delights Mint Chip ice cream is delicious! I left it out of the freezer for 5min so the sides were a bit melted while the middle remained frozen. The mint gave the ice cream a refreshing flavor while the chocolate gave it a nice crunch. All in all I was able to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings and not feel one bit of guilt for eating the entire pint since theres so few calories!
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I eat mint chip ice cream every week and it has been a favorite of mine my whole life( I’m 49 years old) . I tried the cookies and cream in the delights and loved it but the mint one is just too strong and I can’t spend $5 on a pint that has such a strong mint aftertaste. I was very disappointed and hope the company will correct this. If they do, I will buy it every week."
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Agree with some of the other comments. Rock solid. Even after sitting out for 10 minutes. Also turned off by the space in the container and icy (freezer burn?) top. I didnt even eat it. I love regular Breyers ice cream so I thought this would be better than the other low calorie/high protein ice creams. Nope. Five dollars not well spent.
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I was excited to try the delights for the first time, I normally get the ""gold top"" but I was pretty disappointed to see that it was freezer burnt. Bought from Winn Dixie, opened immediately after I got hhome. I was expecting better after having paid $5.49. I bought the cookies and cream also, so hopefully that one is better."
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Usually I eat the Halo ice cream but when I saw Breyers did a lite ice cream that followed my diets guidelines I went in! I’m bummed Publix no longer carries it but they had it on clearance for a while for 1.75 and I probably ate my fair share of it while i could. It’s my absolute favorite healthy ice cream.
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,I was not very pleased. The texture was not that great. It was hard as a rock. The flavor was good but a little strong. However I love mint. I received a coupon from Influenster to try this product for free. I dont think I will be buying this in the future. I do love Breyers other products though.
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream wasn’t as good as I expected it to be, it was a lot harder of an ice cream, even after sitting out for a few minutes it was still rock solid. It was very minty which I enjoyed but the after taste was terrible. I got to try this ice cream out from Influenster for free!"
8_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Container is missing about a fourth of the product once you open it, made me think it was freezer burnt. There is no creaminess to it, just like eating mint flavored ice because I had to microwave it to get it out of the container. Certainly not worth 5 dollars"
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,We loved the new Bryers Mint Chip. Mint chip is our favorite flavor and I was very surprised that it was low calorie. It tasted just as good as the regular Bryers mint chip but without all the guilt. We will definitely be purchasing more.
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Ive had the other brand of Low Cal ice cream and thought this was comparable. Plus it was $2 cheaper per pint ! Flavor was perfect for a low calorie ice cream treat. I dont normally love mint chocolate chip but did like this.
8_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I think this new flavor from breyers is some of the best ice cream Ive ever tried. Its soft and smooth and I love the mint mixed in with the chocolate. Its great by itself but its awesome and a smoothie or a shake.
8_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I purchased the mint chip container. I wasnt expecting ""ice cream"" but I wasnt expecting a flavorless ice either. I also expected a filled container, and not one 3/4 full."

9_breyers,4,11.0,0.0,"For a lower calorie ice cream I was pleasantly surprised with both the flavor and texture. It had the right amount of cookies (not too much, and definitely not too little and not too chunky either) and a nice touch of what had to be vanilla. The texture was MUCH better than other lower calorie ice creams, ALMOST as great as the ""real thing"". It was just icy enough though that I am not certain I will buy it again though, unless I am in the mood for an iced milk type ice cream. Definitely happy to have had the chance to give this product a try, and was extremely skeptical at first, but was glad Breyers completely surprised me with this great product."
9_breyers,5,57.0,6.0,"I must say, when I found out Breyers jumped on the healthy ice cream bandwagon I could hardly contain my excitement, as I consume other brand protein ice creams daily! If you enjoy Breyers cookies and cream ice cream, youll easily love this pint without a doubt. Unlike other brand protein ice creams, this one tastes less artificially sweet and more like real ice cream. Personally, Ill admit I miss the artificial sweetness but it was nice having something that tasted like the real thing, and Breyers was very generous with their mix-ins unlike another big brand. There are a ton of cookie mix-ins, but I didnt really find many cream mix-ins. Still, for a 330 calorie pint of ice cream containing 20 grams of protein I cant hold this against Breyers, everything else was phenomenal! Not thin and icy, but perfect ice cream texture and rich flavor! I would love to see Breyers release more flavors soon that distinguish them from competitors (such as a cotton candy, carrot cake, pumpkin pie, eggnog, pecan pie), or at least more indulgent flavors like chocolate peanut butter swirl, cookie dough, and red velvet."

I wanted to give it another try so I checked out the Breyers Delights Cookies and Cream version (which is my husbands favorite flavor). We were both big fans! The ratio of cookies to cream was perfect, and the taste of the cookies helped offset some of the aftertaste that I didnt like in the Creamy Chocolate version. The ice cream tasted creamy, and it was a good texture after I microwaved it for 15 seconds. I drizzled some low calorie chocolate sauce on it and had it in a cone, and I didnt feel like I was eating a low calorie treat at all! I will be repurchasing this flavor, for sure!"

But it’s happened. I bought this (I live thirty seconds from the store...I timed it) brought it home, put it in my freezer. Well I just unwrapped it and opened it...my face must have been great. Normally it’s creamy it tastes like real ice cream and has real cookies, rather than some similar brands, which have fake chunks. This is like cookie water that was frozen. I have tried all of the flavors and loved this one a lot, but I don’t know. It’s awful. I’d have given it zero stars, buuut, my other purchases have been great so I gave it two for normally being great. Highly disappointed. I did not pay five bucks for half a pint of watery cookies. I could make that here for a lot cheaper. That is legit still frozen."
9_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,I love ice cream but I am on weight watchers so I am trying to watch the nutrition facts but I still want food to taste like food. I came across Breyers Delights and it is yummy!

9_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I have tried Halo Top and Enlightened ice-cream that have similar calorie contents. Comparing the Breyers with the Halo top cookies and cream I would say Breyers tastes better. It is a little more creamy. Also, if you are watching your cholesterol the entire pint has 30 mg of cholesterol whereas Halo Top has 160 mg. That is quite a difference.

I was taken aback when I opened the container and it looked like it had just been spit out of a factory machine - still in an exact cylinder and not relaxed into the container. Then, I went to taste it and it was (still is) hard as a rock! Its hard to eat! The flavor seemed fine, but its a struggle to get a spoonful. Certainly could not be scooped onto a cone. This has potential - perhaps you could fix the issues and turn 2 stars into 5??"
10_breyers,5,6.0,0.0,"I picked this when my grocery store was out of another popular brand of ""light"" ice cream, and I am so glad I did! I am a Breyers convert. This is the best version of lower cal ice cream Ive tried- the texture was perfectly creamy, and the vanilla flavor was spot on, super satisfying! There was a slight sweetener aftertaste with the first bite, but such is the price we pay to eat a pint of ice cream for 260 calories. I was very impressed with the quality of this product and look forward to stressing out when I cant find it in stores because its sold out everywhere in the future."
10_breyers,2,6.0,0.0,"Im not sure what the problem is as I had a good experience with the cookies and cream flavor, but I bought 4 different pints of vanilla thinking it would be a great treat and awesome base for smoothies. In each container, it was pictured as another reviewer had shown, with the ice cream not actually reaching the sides of the container. And it was hard as A ROCK. I let thaw for 15 minutes and still had difficulty with scooping. I understand that many of these lower calorie ice creams require some time to de-thaw, but when I finally did break a chunk free, the texture was just off. WIsh I had photos to upload, but pints were eventually consumed."
10_breyers,1,9.0,1.0,"I love vanilla, my favorite flavor, and im not really picky about vanilla bean. Ive had other light ice creams so I dont mind them.. However, I found this one to be really disappointing.... I ordered a couple through a delivery service for my self and a few friends to make root beer floats.... I found this ice cream to be really hard first off.... not creamy.... .the texture was chalky... It just wasnt like ice cream..... It was bad... its been a few weeks now and its still sitting in the freezer... it lasted through a heat wave.... Definitely the worst Ive ever tried... Im disappointed I wasted so much money on crummy ice cream."
10_breyers,4,11.0,0.0,"Although this ice cream does not taste as close to regular ice cream as Breyers Delights Cookies & Cream flavor, I am glad and respect Breyers for using erythritol instead of aspartame or sucralose to sweeten the pint. Personally, I cant stand the taste of most sucralose sweetened ice creams, but erythritol is much sweeter, cleaner, and satisfying in my opinion. I can imagine not as many people will like this flavor compared to others Breyers released that taste less like diet ice cream, but its still impressive and very satisfying - especially knowing an entire pint has just 260 calories and contains 20 grams of protein! Love the specks of vanilla bean throughout this. One quick tip: either let the ice cream pint thaw for about 10-20 minutes, or microwave for 10-20 seconds before digging in. It gets DENSE!"
10_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"Figured I try this product as an alternative to Halo and i like Breyers products. Purchased yesterday and opened it up tonight, much to my surprise it looks as though an entire serving is missing. Maybe this adds to the lower calorie count. Gave the ice cream a try and it was a bit disappointing. Maybe it’ll work out in my protein shakes but I won’t be purchasing again anytime soon."
10_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Anyone who know me knows that Im all about chocolate. Unfortuneately, there wasnt any chocolate when I came across Delights at my local grocer. So I settled on vanilla and cookies and cream. So far, Ive only tried the vanilla and to my amazement it was delicious! I left it out to soften a little which in my opinion is the best way to eat ice cream. Today Ill try the cookies and cream and Im expecting it to be even better than the vanilla. Thanks Breyers for making a natural, low-cal ice cream that tastes delicious. Now if I can just come up with some self-control so I dont eat the whole pint in one sitting!"
10_breyers,2,4.0,1.0,"This is the second container of Breyers Delights Vanilla Bean that Ive opened. Both half pints were half full. Look at the attached picture. You can see what I encountered upon opening it. You can also see my spoon imprint where the product was so hard that I couldnt scoop it. I love Breyers regular Vanilla Bean and was thrilled to find it in low calorie treat, but this is ridiculous. Im sticking with Halo Top."
10_breyers,5,33.0,1.0,Bought this because it was on sale. This is creamy and doesnt taste artificial. I also tried the creamy chocolate. It is DELICIOUS! I hope they come out with more flavors. Some kind of brownie mix or cookie dough would be awesome!
10_breyers,3,2.0,0.0,"I really like the vanilla bean flavor. It’s very simple and nice if you want to add other things to your ice cream. My biggest problem, and this is the second time it’s happened to me, is that the pints are not always full. I’ve bought two pints that have only been filled 2/3-3/4 full, which makes me feel as if I’m not getting my money’s worth, because it is expensive."
10_breyers,3,4.0,0.0,"I was really excited to try a lower calorie option of a really good brand of ice cream, however it didnt meet my expectations/hopes. Before buying this product I would want to know if it had good flavor and texture. And I wasnt a huge fan of either. I thought it wasnt as soft and creamy as regular ice cream. It had more of an icy texture and flavor. And it felt like they increased the vanilla flavor to overpower the less creaminess. Maybe another flavor would have been better, but this definitely isnt my favorite."
10_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"The product was extremely hard to find in my state. I had to go to a couple of different stores in order to get this. I found it in the Wegmans where I live. The size is a standard pint which is great for individual late night snacking. The taste, however, really threw me off a bit. It left an after taste in my mouth that I did not appreciate. You definitely taste the vanilla bean like you normally would which is great, but the after taste was not very pleasant to me. If this was more readily available and the after taste was better, I would have gave it five stars."
10_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Not worth the price. I was excited because I like Breyers products. However, it was impossible to scoop the vanilla bean without letting it soften. It was like eating a brick. Hard and tasteless. Ive had Halo top before and it was wayyyyyy better. Breyers you missed the mark on this one and I would like a refund for the 2 pints I bought for $4.29 each. I wish I had only opened one, but I thought the hardness was just maybe a store handling issue, but nope the 2nd was a brick as well. Thanks"
10_breyers,1,4.0,1.0,"I purchased a pint of the vanilla delights. On the 20 minute car ride home it melted....no biggie I thought happens all the time. I place it in the freezer. The next day I take said pint out of freezer to get a serving of the ice cream. Its hard as a brick! Okay I leave it out for a little bit.....still hard. Cant eat the stuff its either soup or concrete!!!!!! Worst waste if 4.49!!!!!!!! I could purchase Halo Top for that kind of scratch! Very, very disappointed."
10_breyers,4,2.0,1.0,"Breyers delights Vanilla Bean ice cream is so delightfully creamy and thick that I would not have suspected that this is a low calorie / low fat ice cream were it not for the label. The entire pint, in fact, contains only 260 calories and 7 grams of fat! The presence of real cream and eggs is no doubt the reason for the rich and creamy taste. The ice cream also has a full, bold vanilla flavor attributable to the presence of real vanilla bean. Breyers delights is also a good source of protein and is relatively low in sodium. There are 20 grams of protein and 160 mg of sodium per PINT! About the only downside is the somewhat overly sweet aftertaste from the use of the natural sugar substitutes, erythritol and stevia. Highly recommended!"
10_breyers,3,4.0,0.0,If you take 7 grams of sugar and add 1/2 of sugar alcohols 3 you get 10 grams of sugar. Dont forget the servings. Multiply 10 x 3 servings and you get 30 grams of sugar. A snickers bar has 27 grams of sugar.
10_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream was in a perfect sphere shape and much smaller than the pint container size. It was also hard as a rock. I wasn’t positive that this was the way it was supposed to look, or if it had melted and leaked out during transit to my grocery store. I sent info to customer service asking if it was supposed to look like this or if there was an issue with it. After reading the reviews, I see this is just how this product looks. It will stay in the trash and I’ll stick to Halo Top."
10_breyers,2,4.0,1.0,The ice cream is good but not great. Although the classic vanilla flavor is there the taste is powdery and not too strong.
10_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"There are a few things about this product that I did not like, but let me tell you why I am at least giving it one star. I like the fact that Breyers is thinking about those who are trying to eat healthy. With their pints and the most calories one has is 330 calories this is a way for people to be able to indulge without feeling guilty and satisfy a craving! I tried the vanilla. When I opened the pint it had a slight smell of alcohol from the vanilla flavor. Which in the smell transfer to an alcohol like after taste. The other reason I did not like this product was the texture. The texture of this product was gritty like having a small sandy type texture in my mouth as well as crumbly. By crumbly I mean that if you scoop it with an ice cream scoop unlike most it does not do a smooth, full scoop but crumbles instead. So bottom line I would not recommend this, but instead another brand that offers this type of product and has a better variety of flavors"
10_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I was excited to see that Breyers had a low calorie ice cream and I was sure that it would be better than Halo. My container was half empty so I didnt want to try the ice cream. I guess I’ll return the product.
10_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Absolutely the worst frozen dessert Ive ever tried - forget about ""fresh cream flavor"". Impossible to even get it out of the carton - frozen rock solid. Looked like an iceberg. Try again, Breyers!"
10_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"Nice texture, but sweeter than average ice cream, and overpowering vanilla. Gotta say Ill be sticking with Halo Tops vanilla which has a more natural vanilla flavor and is kinda custardy."
10_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Contains Splenda (erythritol) and stevia. No wonder it has a horrid aftertaste. I would rather skip ice cream than put those two ingredients in my body.
10_breyers,5,5.0,2.0,Loved the ice cream would buy again at the store and try more flavors
10_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Will NEVER buy again. Nasty flavor. I have loved Breyers most of my life ( I am 72 )
10_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,This product was extremely hard to find in my area. I had to travel an hour and a half to purchase this product. (Which I wouldnt normally do). It has that wonderful vanilla bean taste that I love. Its the perfect size me for my late night snacking and with only 260 calories per serving I want regret eating this late night. Its a delicious low calorie snack that the kids and I love.
10_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,"This ice cream was so so good!!!! Not only did it have just 260 calories, it also has 20g of protein!!! If youre anything like me, you can easily eat a pint to yourself, and with this new Breyers Delights ice cream, you can eat away and feel a little less guilty! So go a head and enjoy that rich, creamy Breyers taste!!"
10_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,I am an ice cream lover and this ice cream did not hit the spot for me. Vanilla Bean is my favorite flavor but I didnt feel like this ice cream was creamy. I was very stiff. It is wonderful that the whole pint only has 260 calories but its not a product I would purchase again. It is also pricey for a pint of ice cream.
10_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Bought this thinking I love Breyers this should be good. I was wrong container wasnt full, like a rock and the taste was bland couldnt taste anything vanilla. Very disappointed."
11_breyers,2,6.0,1.0,"I have always had an up and down relationship with Breyers ice cream, in the past the ice cream has ice chucks in it which always turns me off. I tried the French Vanilla ice cream, it is so much creamery then the ice cream i have had from them in the past, but it still has the off putting ice chucks. I found that you cannot eat this ice cream alone, it has to be paired with something to give it a little help it needs. I preferred using it to make Coke Floats or turning it into ice cream cake. Giving it another ingredient sharpens the Vanilla flavor and hides the cheap processed feel of the ice cream."
11_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,The Breyers ice cream was easy to find in the frozen section of the grocery store. Even though the carton seems smaller than other half gallons it has the same amount - I checked! Its just me and my daughters at home and we love ice cream so this was perfect. I decided to just have the ice cream without any toppings so we could really get the flavor and we certainly did. This seemed much creamier than other brands we tried which made it feel really indulgent. I could see us using toppings another time or alongside an apple crisp. We will definitely get this again.
11_breyers,3,7.0,2.0,"This ice cream package says ""indulgently rich & silky smooth"". It isnt really either of those things. Its trying to be a premium ice cream, and while it doesnt fail miserably, it does fall short if the mark. It looks inviting, with lots of flecks of vanilla, but as soon as I scooped some up I realized it was not what it is pretending to be. The texture was way too light and fluffy to be a premium ice cream. A premium ice cream should be a more dense texture, this was almost marshmallow-y it was so light. The flavor wasnt bad, no artificial vanilla flavor, but it didnt really have a lot of flavor, it was kind of bland. If youre using this as a base for something like an ice cream cake or, mixing things into it, this could be a good choice, but for straight eating, next time Ill pass."
11_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I have always really liked Breyers simple all natural approach. Now its even better knowing that it is Rainforest Alliance Certified. So not only do I get really great tasting ice cream, but as an added bonus I can feel good about how Breyer’s is looking to help protect rainforests and its wildlife. This icecream just keeps getting better."
11_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"This is the only flavor and brand, that I will put next to my homemade apple pies! I make them in the winter months and it slightly warms up the ice cream, which tastes just delicious. Natural & simple ingredients are also a plus, since we do not eat processed foods in our home."
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"French vanilla is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. Breyers does it well, with a nice creamy, smooth taste that really feels luxurious and indulgent. I could eat it plain by the bucketful(and may have haha), but I love to change it up sometimes by adding some fresh raspberries. Fresh fruit really complements the richness of the ice cream. Im excited to try this with waffles for a super delicious brunch treat. Yum yum!"
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This is a great vanilla ice cream. Its very creamy in flavor and texture, delicious when made into a milkshake or just consumed alone. Im a sucker for milkshakes, and with almond milk or regular milk, this has a great texture and flavor! Of course, french vanilla is always great for a sundae night too and makes a great base for family fun with toppings! Fans of vanilla ice creams will really enjoy this one!"
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I was very impressed with the Breyers French Vanilla Ice Cream. It has a great smooth consistency and was very easy to scoop. The flavor was excellent. Nice and rich just as the package describes. I generally purchase ice cream with chunks or swirls in it. This will be a nice addition to my future ice cream purchases. I used this as a snack in a bowl, pie topper and also to make some milk shakes!!"
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Ive already been a big fan of Breyers Ice Cream. Their chocolate and Rocky Road flavors are my absolute favorite. French Vanilla might be right up there with them now! I love the real vanilla flavor in there and it is sooo creamy. I put it in an ice cream sundae with hot fudge and it was fantastic. Then I put a scoop on a waffle! Definitely will be buying this again.
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I love Breyers ice cream, because its all natural, and it has a true taste of flavor---no added artificial chemicals, etc.( I tried the Extra Creamy Vanilla). We have been buying this brand for years, because of its reputation and long-standing manufacturing. So, if youre looking for all-natural ice cream with a true taste of flavor...buy Breyers :)"
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I love ice cream! We eat it almost every night. Breyers French vanilla is more than just vanilla Ice cream. It is like a heavenly decadent treat. Pair it with pie, cake, on a waffle in a cone or in a bowl with fruit or hot fudge, or eat it plain .....no matter how you eat it, you will enjoy a delightful taste sensation."
11_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,This isnt what we remember having in the past with your French vanilla. Its flavor was lacking and it honestly reminded my family of cheap McDonalds ice cream... really disappointed since we purchased 5 boxes. Was not the rich french vanilla flavor we have had in the past. Had an artificial aftertaste.
11_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is delicious. We used it to make cookie ice cream sandwiches. My family loved them I couldnt make them fast enough. They were so smooth and creamy. I would definitely buy this product again.
12_breyers,3,63.0,2.0,"Not going to lie, this product is amazing. Its creamy and tasty. Ive used it for years. When I first started buying it, the net carbs was 4. Easy to incorporate into my macros. Not sure why they opted to mess with the recipe on this, but the net carbs has gone up to 7, but the flavor and texture havent changed. And the packaging is a little misleading. Where it used to say net carbs, they now say how many sugars instead. For people actually doing low Carb (<30 a day), this isnt feasible to incorporate. Please go back to the old recipe!!! It was equally amazing as the product now, and I could actually eat it regularly."
12_breyers,2,42.0,0.0,"I totally agree with all those who are disappointed in the change to CarbSmart. I have been buying it for a couple years because I am following Atkins & had not need to look at the nutrition label...I knew it was 4 net carbs. I began loading information on the Atkins site for my food and that is when I looked at the label again & was shocked to see it was almost double the carbs! I will have to change or not eat it at all...I cant work it in anymore. I am not sure why you changed...probably cost as everyone wants to go easy/cheap anymore. Dont get me wrong, the taste is amazing...just cant follow for low-carb diet. Please, re-think your recipe...I will miss you!"
12_breyers,5,28.0,6.0,"I can create any number of flavors using this ice cream as a base. I put about 25% of the carton contents into a bowl thats been in the freezer (a la Cold Stone). I add a tiny bit of liqueur (creme de cacao or amaretto for instance) for texture. For a very tasty chocolate ice cream I add low- or no-sugar cocoa powder and a bit of malt powder. With a large spoon I ""knead"" the ice cream about 5 minutes, until the texture is silky-smooth. Or I can make a chocolate chip flavor by adding one or two squares of 70% chocolate bar that Ive crushed with a meat tenderizer. Ive made chocolate mint and a host of other flavors. Add-in possibilities are numerous; I like toasted coconut flakes or toasted almond slivers."
12_breyers,1,67.0,3.0,"This was THE longed-for treat when I tighten up on carbs. I actually really liked the taste and texture. It HAD 4 grams of fiber, 4 grams of sugar, and 6 g of sugar alcohol blended up in a 120 calorie per serving portion. Now it has 90 calories (something a lot of carb watchers dont care too much about), 0 grams of fiber, 3 grams of sugar, 5 grams of sugar alcohol per serving. Net carbs WERE 4 g per serving and NOW are 7 g per serving. The main difference appears to be the substitution of the ubiquitous (meaning probably cheaper) corn-sourced, high GI maltodextrin for the high fiber polydextrose. The fat count has also dropped from 6 g to 5 g. While some may prefer the corn over the synthetic fiber, only carb watchers with digestive sensitivities to poly-D might prefer this version. This is no longer ""Carb Smart"" dessert!"
12_breyers,1,27.0,0.0,"The “new and improved” formula contains maltodextrin, which has been shown to raise blood sugar and can kick you out of ketosis.

12_breyers,1,148.0,18.0,"I trusted this brand to fit into my Keto lifestyle. However, now the ""new and improved"" recipe has nearly twice the net carbs it used to have (4g, now 7g). Thats big chunk of a ketogains day when their limit is only 20g net carbs PER DAY. You really alienated a large customer base for carb smart. I will longer be purchasing this brand."
12_breyers,1,20.0,0.0,This is my regularly stocked ice cream and has been for years. Just noticed the new recipe and the doubling of net carbs (from 4 to 7). They just lost me as a VERY loyal customer. Will be switching brands.

12_breyers,1,13.0,1.0,Bryers has changed the recipe and it’s disappointing. I will no longer purchase this product anymore. The carbs have almost doubled. I won’t sacrifice 7 carbs for 1/2 a cup of ice cream. I’m so unhappy right now. I didn’t notice the label until I was home which means I’m going to throw it away and lose my money. Imagine an upset emoji face
12_breyers,2,10.0,0.0,"Why did you change the recipe / formula ? Was so very creamy prior to the change, and all you saved was 30 calories, not sure if I will continue to purchase. Might buy Halo as you now have the same texture as Halo and Halo has multiple flavors."

12_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Will no longer buy this product since the recipe change doubled the net carb count. Hopefully the cost you save on what I am sure is a less expensive recipe is more than the sales you will loose from Keto/low carb customers not buying your product any longer.
12_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Net carbs nearly doubled! No vanilla specs like before. Doesn’t taste as “Vanilla Breyers” as it did before. PLEASE go back to the old recipe. There are other carb friendly ice creams I need to consider buying vs Breyers CarbSmart now.

For those that have severe lactose intolerance, there are few options that you have in general when it comes to true dairy free products. This is a great product & we’ve been enjoying this during stressful times in moderation! Just gotta know your body. Although we have noticed that the bean granules have been missing from our recent batches that we’ve grown fond to seeing, it’s still yummy"
13_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I love the lactose free chocolate. Its rich and creamy. The vanilla lactose with vanilla bean specs not so much. Please make a creamy homemade vanilla without specs as good as the chocolate!
13_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,I have been lactose intolerant for years. Every night this is my go to snack. I have tried others but there is no comparison. Thank you for such a great product!!
13_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Picked up a non-expired gallon of this from the store and it was awful. It was grey in color speckled with black bits - looked like cookies n cream ice cream and for a moment I thought maybe the wrong flavor had just been put into the container. But it tasted like vanilla extract overload and sour milk (funny since its lactose free). It also didnt freeze right and overall was disappointing. Will not purchase again.
13_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"I have noticed lately that its a hit or miss with the ice cream. Some instances when I buy this I will get the lactose free vanilla ice cream with vanilla beans and taste.. Other instances there are no beans and the ice cream is very bland. Not sure whats going on, but I do hope they fix this soon.. The inconsistency in the product is enough to make me move on to a different product."
13_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I have had to many EXPENSIVE gross dairy free ice creams because of the “intolerance” that afflicts me.. I have been shown the way, a new breathe of life with the brewers lactose free ice cream! It’s so much better than lactaids version! Now.. about that mint chocolate chip flavor in lactose free... where do we land on that?"
13_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Not creamy and smooth anymore. Black pecks were awful and a little chunky. Ive used this ice cream for a few years but will not buy again. Threw out the last container. I used to give it to my dogs too on hot days but will not even give it to them anymore. Please bring back the old Lactose vanilla!
13_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love Breyers Lactose Free Light ice cream. Its delicious and creamy! If youre lactose intolerant give Breyers a try.....you wont be disappointed.
13_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Are you discontinuing this ice cream?......rumors! I hope not. it is and has been the best option for lactose free ice cream for flavor, value, and texture."
14_breyers,5,6.0,2.0,"This is the BEST ice cream ever! Thanks for making the No Sugar Added ice cream! This is so good, I cant tell the difference between regular ice cream and the No Sugar added. This is wonderful for folks that have to watch their sugar intake. Thanks Breyers!!"
14_breyers,5,4.0,1.0,Honestly I could not tell a difference in this no sugar added than that with it! Will make this my go to from now on
14_breyers,5,4.0,3.0,Ive been trying different ice creams with lower calorie content and i think i found the one im sticking with. Ive tried the breyers delight frozen greek yogurt which is also good but its not the same creamy texture as this one. I just wish they used the natural sweetener stevia like in the frozen yogurt instead of the artificial sweetener sucralose
14_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,"I absolutely love this flavor, it is delicious, creamy and totally satisfies my Ice Cream craze."
15_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,If I wanted vanilla ice cream I would have purchased it. Dug through in hopes of finding some oreos... no luck. And obviously this an on going issue from what I read of other reviews.
15_breyers,1,8.0,2.0,So disappointed. I probably got 2 maybe 3 tiny little pieces of oreo. Its more like crumbs not pieces.
15_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,"It’s a great flavors, WHEN there are actual cookies in it, and not just a rub of Vanilla ice cream."
15_breyers,1,4.0,1.0,"I was getting over a break up and i got this icecream to feel better and it’s just made me more sad then ever when I saw there was no Oreo inside I was expecting 20% more cookies, but no it’s just plain icecream . #findingtheoreo"
15_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,Suppose to be 20% more Oreos have yet to find a single cookie in this quart. I keep digging and I haven’t found a single Oreo.
15_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,Can’t find the 20% more Oreos. Literally vanilla ice cream! This made me more depressed than I was. The decepción.
15_breyers,2,5.0,0.0,This was vanilla ice cream in a cookies and cream package. So disappointing.
15_breyers,1,5.0,1.0,Recently just got this ice cream and unfortunately there was no Oreos at all in the tub! Looks more like vanilla then cookies and cream!
15_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,Where are the Oreos? This Cookies and Cream is Rookies and Cream.
15_breyers,2,6.0,1.0,"“Frozen Dairy Dessert” says it all. This is so far from real ice cream that they don’t even call it ice cream on the label. It tasted like sweet foam with cookie chunks. I gave it two stars because at least it was sweet and cold. Disappointed in the overall product. It was foamy and soft, and definitely wasn’t ice cream."
15_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"Where are the cookies? This is basicly creamy foam with no cookies. My husband bought this because itwas on sale. Not even worth buying on sale, a complete waste of money."
15_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"After staying away from Breyers for a decade, I decided to give them a try. What a mistake!!! Little did I know that things that are NOT ice cream hide out in the ice cream section of the freezer at the grocery store. ""Frozen Dairy Dessert."" Ha. What a joke. I thought that this stuff was disgusting."
15_breyers,1,5.0,2.0,"Product did not have ice cream consistence - like mush! Bought 2 containers-1 to make dessert for company. Since it never hardened up-dessert splatted when removed from pan. 2nd container-same consistency & no flavor. Family wouldnt even eat it. Yes-my freezer works. Not happy-spent time, $ and still have no dessert to serve"
15_breyers,1,3.0,2.0,What happened to the chocolate with oreo? That was so much better and I have not been able to find it in stores anymore. The vanilla is boring and unoriginal. Bring back the chocolate with oreos!
15_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I dont usually write reviews, but this ice cream was such a waste. Very bland with the occasional bit of cookie (that also didnt taste like anything). Definitely flavor. Totally not good."
16_breyers,5,6.0,0.0,Omg!!! This ice cream has definitely become a family favorite. Chips ahoy and Oreos are my favorite cookies. To have both of them at once has definitely been addictive. This ice cream taste just like the cookies I love only with the creamy delicious smoothness of ice cream. We enjoyed it so much that I went to the store and purchased three more flavors. I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes.
16_breyers,4,4.0,0.0,"I received this for free for testing and reviewing purposes, and all opnions are my own. I was expecting this to be too sweet, but surprisingly it was just right. We had it for dessert and my sons and husband enjoyed it as well. I loved that it has big chunks of chips ahoy throughout. I think this might be a new family favorite."
16_breyers,5,6.0,0.0,"My son (20yrs old) told me about this awesome ice cream mixture. Of course I needed to try it along with a few other flavors. Well 4 cartons later, we all agree it is the best idea EVER!!! We had company and they were all thrilled with the choices and said they were going to get it the next shopping trip. Seriously who hasnt gotten double dip ice cream in different flavors? Now in the came carton mixed with extras???? WIN WIN. I will be trying the new versions with less calories. With Breyers attention to detail I am hoping the flavors make you forget it is diet, the carb smart bars were very good. I was very fortunate to received this product free for testing. I of course purchased extra to make sure the evaluation was accurate. *grin*"
16_breyers,4,3.0,0.0,"I am a big time ice cream lover and keep our freezer stocked with all our favorite flavors. I was super excited to try this new 2in1 flavor from Breyers. The branding and packaging were very attractive and I was especially drawn in by this particular flavor combination, thinking there would be quite a good amount of both types of cookies. While I really love the overall taste of the ice cream, I was really bummed to see that most of the ice cream was filled with Oreos and there were barely any Chips Ahoy! cookies. My biggest suggestion is that this flavor truly have equal amounts of both so it feels like ""2in1"". I received this product for free in exchange for my review."
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"The Breyers two in one is an awesome idea! I love mixing my icecrems, with a dessert, like a cookie or brownies! So this kindof already did that for me! The ice cream was mostly Oreo cookie, with some chips ahoy chunks in it. It was smooth and the cookies werent soggy, they were still pretty crunchy, which I loved. I think this was a fun idea and is something I will be repurchasing because it tasted so good! I love Breyers for their simple ingredients and good quality ice cream! Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves cookies and ice cream! I received this product free for testing and reviewing purposes."
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I bought this for my kids a few weeks ago and they loved it! It was like the best of both worlds in terms of Cookies and Ice Cream. I am going to let them try all the 2in1 Ice Cream flavors just to see which one they prefer best! If you all made a dairyfree Keto friendly version, I would definitely eat some too. Thanks for making the Carbsmart Ice Cream because I am on a Low Carb Lifestyle and your CarbSmart Ice Cream makes life so much more enjoyable and this lifestyle so much more easier, so THANK YOU! Thanks Breyers for making me and my kids smile!! Oh, and look forward to posting future reviews on the other 2in1 flavors!"
16_breyers,5,6.0,1.0,Brought this yesterday because it said new I like trying new food items OMG...LIFE CHANGER!! This is AWESOMENESS!!! Taste really good. Thanks for the change up.
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Got to test this sweet and amazing treat for FREE thanks to Influenster! I have to say it was between this and the Reese’s cup and Reese’s pieces but ultimately the cookies one! This ice cream delicious...soft to dig right into...and full of Oreos and chocolate pieces! Literally I taste both Chips ahoy and Oreo. Great treat for the Summer or anytime...especially if you are a cookie lover like me :)
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"As Breyers is a ""dairy dessert"" and not labeled ""ice cream"" I usually find the texture is too filmy for my liking but this new cookie duo is fantastic! I love the two flavors together and managed to get real cookie bits in every bite. Was also a hit with my ten year old daughter! Thank you @influenster and @breyers for providing this free product for testing! #movienight"
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Creamy ice cream with the Perfect combination Oreo chunks and chocolate chip cookie dough pieces! love that I can have two of my favorite ice cream flavors in one tub now! Great prices and plenty to share! My kids loved it also! *i received this product complimentary from Influenster for product testing and reviews*
16_breyers,4,2.0,1.0,I received this product complimentary through Influenster. I’m a mom of 6 so a trying out a treat was wonderful. My eldest who is a tween likes it but didn’t favorite this particular flavor (she voted for the Reese’s but majority rules) my preschooler loved the fact that he had two cookie flavors even though he was my eldests counterpart in the flavor vote. The four in the middle said that it had the perfect amount of cookies and it was sweet and creamy. They loved it.
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This is a perfect blend of two different cookies in one ice cream! At first you taste a little bit more of the Oreo because I feel that the cookie’s texture influences the vanilla ice cream the most but then you definitely get blasts of Chips Ahoy cookies as well. I would purchase this again
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I want to let you know that this oreo and chips ahoy 2in1 is so delicious, is creamy, soft, the combination of 2 flavors are amazing. Really good taste, great package, easy to open, the ice cream melts in your mouth like cotton candy."
16_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I had hi hopes this would taste like Oreos and chips ahoy :-(. Unfortunately taste like artificial Oreo and where are the chips ahoy. I wouldnt recommend this to a friend & I wish I could get my money back.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"I got this kind for movie night with mynieces and nephews and it was huge hit! They lived the fact that they were getting two kind of ice cream in one box and the two flavors were a great combo to put together. The vanilla was a good base and the cookie chunks were small which made it easier to eat, especially for kids. The only change I would make is separate the kinds in the container a bit more so it was easier to tell which kind you were eating. On some parts of the container they were almost completely blended so it was hard to tell it was a 2in1. I received this item for free for an honest review"
16_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,We decide to stay with the basics because we love cookies and cream .. we definitely were not disappointed with this leave her chips ahoy part was so yummy and of course our number one cookies and cream. Breyers always has the best ice cream you will not be disappointed with this flavor .
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I was surprised at how good this Ice Cream was, i got the Chips Ahoy and Oreos and it was AMAZING! INFLUENSTER sent me a free coupon to try it and I am so thankful! Delicious!"
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Perfect Oreo & Chips ahoy combo. These two cookies make the perfect pair for an ice cream blend. Huge chunks of cookie make for a delicious bite!
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,I received a free coupon from influenster to try a breyers product. I picked this because of the cookies! It did not disappoint. Delicious!!!
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Great flavor taste and consistency a great and fun blend of flavors
16_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I have purchased this flavor countless times, hoping that the lack of Chips Ahoy was a temporary quality control failure. To my dismay, every single pint of this ice cream I’ve ever seen only has by, volume, about 1/10th of the pint’s worth of Chips Ahoy. It’s a shame as well, die to the fact that there is no standalone Chips Ahoy pint. There is an Oreo one, in fact, and this “2 in 1”, but no Chips Ahoy. Very disappointed, both by the fact that this has happened, and also by the fact that this is only an online review, and will likely never be considered."
16_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"Who says you cant have both? Breyers recently came out with a 2in1 ice cream where you dont have to choose! Breyers has 4 different flavors to choose from, Oreo and Chips Ahoy, Reese and Reeses Pieces, Snickers and MnMs, and Heath and Waffle Cone. I got the Breyers Oreo and Chips Ahoy 2in1 ice cream since me and my boys love the cookies itself. Packaging was good, clearly shows that half of the tub should be Oreo and half should be Chips Ahoy. Opened it at home and it was a disappointment because I couldnt distinguish which is which, I guess it melted and got frozen so it got mixed up together. Went to dig in the ice cream and I was surprised how I saw chunks of Oreo and chips ahoy cookies. I was more excited to try it than the kids were probably because they saw the cookie on table. Had the kids try it first though with the cookie itself and they loved it. I was able to taste both Oreo and Chips Ahoy on the ice cream and I loved it, ice cream was smooth and creamy but didnt eat much though because it was too sweet on my tastebuds. It is a hit with my kids, will definitely buy it again especially this summer in this Last Vegas heat . *Got this free from @influenster . . . . . . . . @breyers #gotitfree #contest #influenster #breyers #complimentary #free #foodie #icecream #2in1 #cookie #icecreamlovers #review #foodporn #yum #cold #breyersicecream #"
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Oreo 2 in 1 with chips ahoy is the greatest cookie ice cream ever made! I am an expert with 41 years of intense study of the craft of enjoying and eating ice cream. If I was on an island with only one choice of food, they would find me curled up in the fetal position with and empty Breyers carton clenched in my hands. Please for all that is Holy and Good in this world please do not take this away from me. I’m straight out begging you, as I now go to the gym just long enough to hammer down some of that delicious goodness. Benny from NH"
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is delicious! Big yummy chunks of cookie! Went beautifully with out first day of summer sleep over! I got mine through Influenster for free, and I am so grateful! Ill definitely be trying Breyers other 2 in 1 flavors!!!"
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,first impressions is wow taste good .. I really enjoy them together . I love cookies and love Oreos .. the taste is amAzing . I enjoy it so much that I actually bought myself another one cuz I know it won’t last forever in my freg ..
16_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,Very disappointed! There was only 1/2”- 3/4” of chips a’hoy swirl! Love their ice cream but I certainly don’t thing this is a 2 in 1.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,One of my favorites from Breyers! Great combination of Oreo and chips ahoy cookies!
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,I absolutely love this ice cream! The chips ahoy part was probably the best ice cream I’ve ever had. The Oreo is by far the best cookies and cream I’ve ever had. There was so many cookie pieces! Not so many cookie piece in the chips ahoy part which was disappointing but maybe that was just he one batch I happened to get. I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it wasn’t 50/50 there was very little chips ahoy ice cream and the Oreo part took up almost 85 percent of the ice cream. I got this product complimentary from influenster for my review.
16_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,Josh peck seemed excited for it therefore I’m excited for it
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Half my kids love cookie dough, how my kids love cookies and cream when it comes to ice cream. It’s a fight when you limit the ice cream to one kind in a shopping trip. But not anymore. The Oreo and chips ahoy 2 in 1 is everything my kids wanted and now they can agree! The ice cream it’s self was yummy and creamy, and perfect for an after dinner treat. Everyone loved it and we will live happily ever after with a just right ice cream. Full disclosure, I received an incentive for this product, but we’ve bought it again and will continue to buy it."
16_breyers,3,13.0,4.0,My tub had 7/8ths Oreo & 1/8 Chips Ahoy! .. it was a real shame considering nobody does Chips Ahoy! Ice cream & it was so good compared to the basic cookies & creme done time & time again.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This is such a great combo for ice cream. I seriously sat and at the whole tub in one sitting (dont judge Im also 8 months pregnant) but this is one of the best ice creams Ive eaten. It was a perfect texture and consistency and didnt over freeze before opening like some ice creams do. The cookies in the ice cream are great sizes and evenly spread throughout the whole tub. 10 out of 10 would recommend and repurchase. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I enjoyed this ice cream. I have been seeing ads for it everywhere and was really excited to try it. the cookie to ice cream ratio was great, I was expecting smaller cookie pieces so I was pleasantly surprised. I didn’t like that there was a lot more Oreo than chips ahoy ice cream. You can find Oreo ice cream everywhere so I was more excited about trying the chips ahoy flavor. Other than that I definitely recommend this ice cream. I received this product free for testing."
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This was a perfect combo. The ice cream was creamy. The Oreo flavor had large cookie chunks and tasted just as expected. My only complaint is that there wasnt an even distribution of chips ahoy to oreo. There was a lot more of the Oreo flavor than the chips ahoy. Overall the ice cream was delicious and a great flavor combo. I look forward to trying the other flavors. Full disclosure: I received the Oreo & Chips Ahoy 2in1 ice cream for free from Influenster to review.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,Loved the idea of combining both of my favorite cookies together in a creamy and smooth ice cream treat! Felt like a little kid again eating my favorites but I definitely was wishing I had a little more Chips Ahoy because I felt like my tub was more Oreo but not worth complaining about. My kids all loved the little bit of salty and sweet and asked for seconds. Got this to try for free but my kids will definitely get me to buy it over and over again.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,Breyers now has 2in1 flavors. I tried the oreo and chips ahoy. Both flavors are really good. It seems as if the oreo is the majority flavor. It is mixed all together and I was not a fan of that. I would prefer to have them separated instead of intermingled. I also do not like the fact that it is called frozen dessert and not ice cream. Overall it is a great product. I received this complimentary from Influenster’s voxbox for testing purposes.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"I really love this combination. Not too sweet and it’s soft! I hate when ice cream is hard as a rock when you take it out the freezer. I like to dive right in and with this combo... no need to wait! Unfortunately, my tube barely had the chips ahoy, it was more like 1/4 had the chips ahoy and the rest Oreo. However, that won’t stop me from purchasing in the future but if my next tube is the same result.. not so sure."
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This ice cream tastes great it has a wonderful combination of flavor makes for a great snack at night for everyone in the family to enjoy
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Just tried this ice cream. I love real Oreo, but mixed with the chips ahoy brought it to a whole new level. My new favorite splurge item!"
16_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love chocolate chip cookies and I love oreos now I have the best of both worlds.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Cookies and cream was my favorite ice cream flavor as a child and chips ahoy are my favorite cookie, so this seemed like the perfect combination of flavors for me. It did not disappoint, although I would have likes more of the chips ahoy flavor for a better balance, because I think Oreos have a stronger flavor in general. Still delicious though. I received this product for free to test"
16_breyers,3,2.0,1.0,I bought this for the first time and there was only the Oreo ice cream and no Chips Ahoy. I’ll definitely try it again as it might have just been the one carton or maybe they melted and mixed and were refrozen but I was very sad. Mainly because I bought it for the chips ahoy and got more oreo than I bargained for. It was a nice price though and always good flavor so I’m not that sad.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I bought the Breyers Oreo and chips ahoy 2 in 1 ice cream for my kiddos and myself to try. My kids were immediately drawn to it considering it is ice cream with both their favorite cookies! We were all pleasantly surprised with how yummy it actually was! It was like cookies and cream with chunks of choco chip cookies! Very tasty! I received this product free for testing.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,We loved it! It was nice to have another cookie besides Oreo. Both tasted exactly like the actual cookies. Th cookie pieces were bigger so it was better than a cookies and cream type. The ice cream was creamy. I enjoyed the combination used. Will definitely purchase again!! Will try other flavors as well. I received this product for free for testing.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,This was definitely a good idea. These cookies are 2 favorites in our house but I cant say Im a huge fan of the combo. The kids didnt seem to mind too much but it sat in my freezer a little longer than most other ice creams. It wont be my go to ice cream but Id buy it again if the kids asked. I received this product for free for testing and reviewing.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I received a coupon to redeem one breyers item complimentary for my honest review. I absolutely LOVE ice cream and cookies so I knew I would love the cookies and cream/ chips ahoy. Breyers is a good quality ice cream packed with indulgence. The flavors made me feel like a little kid again. I would definitely recommend this ice cream, it’s a tasty treat."
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"I had the opportunity to taste this ice cream flavor thanks to Influenster. Half of the ice cream does not disappoint me at all, the taste is really an oreo cookies, the chunks are the perfect size, it is simply addictive, the other half I think it can improve, it tastes like Chips Ahoy but that delicious taste is overshadowed by the taste of Oreo."
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,We tried this a few days ago because we’re obsessed with cookies! (And anything that has to do with them) lol we received a coupon for this so we gave it it a go! I was really impressed with it! It was too sweet and it was super delicious! The cookies aren’t too chunky so it’s easy to scoop! This was definitely a win for us! I highly recommend it.
16_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,Its a whole tub of oreo ice cream with a sliver of chips ahoy. Very dissatisfied
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is a fun concept. The two cookies together make a great pair. I just wish that there was more chips ahoy ice cream mixed in with the Oreo ice cream. My family’s is excited to try the other 2-IN-1 flavors!! This is my 9 year olds new favorite! I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely fell in love with this flavor combination. Being the cookie lover that I am, this just cant be beat.

I received this product free for testing from Influenster."
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,Tried the oreo and chips ahoy flavor and it hit perfectly on our tastebuds as we love both the cookies. The cookies were well blended in the ice cream. We love breyers ice cream as its all natural. Would love to try the other 2 in 1 flavors too. Received this ice cream for free to try the product and review it.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I received this product for free from Influenster. Im so glad that I chose this flavor. It is absolutely the BEST ice cream I have ever had. I love it so much. The Oreo pieces are so crunchy and add a nice texture element to the vanilla ice cream. It also pairs very nicely with the Chips Ahoy cookie.
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,I just bought this ice cream to try for the 1st time. At 1st I was hesitant but OMG its amazing!!!! It tastes so good and everyone in my family lived it.

16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I’m really picky when it comes to desserts, with that said this ice cream is hands down my new favorite! I LOVE the mix of Oreo and Chips Ahoy!

16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I have two kids and they NEVER agree on an ice cream flavor. When I saw Breyers two-in-one, I saw the end to a weekly battle. And if that wasnt reason enough to immediately grab a carton....ITS BREYERS CREAMY DELICIOUS ICE CREAM. High five for this wonderful ice cream combo!!!"
16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"My family loves cookies and cream ice cream. So when we saw this we were sure it would be a hit. And it was good, but not our favorite. The ice cream is creamy and smooth like I expected, it was just a bit sweet for my tastes. The husband on the other hand absolutely loved it!"
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is SO good. My fiancé and I ate the entire tub in just two sittings! What a fantastic combination of cookies. We are very excited to try all the other 2 in 1 combinations! Each week we will try a new flavor together! Keep up the great work breyers!
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Not a huge fan of chips ahoy but this ice cream is incredibly delicious! My family will defiantly be buying this again and recommending it to our friends and family. The combination of cookie flavors was perfect! This is one of the best ice creams Ive had!

16_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,I love Breyers and I love this combination. However the reason for my 4 star rating is that there are mostly Oreo cookie pieces and hardly any Chips Ahoy. Make the amount equal and I would give this 5 stars for sure.
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This duo is the Batman and Robin of ice cream and it has become a new summer favorite in our home . Now we dont have to choose which we like better awesome idea Breyers and it was truly an awesome ice cream .

16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I have never had ice cream that was filled with soooooooo many cookies. This has just the right amount of sweetness and you can actually taste the milk in the ice cream. We cant keep this in our home
16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Tastes like cookies and milk! Super creamy with no artificial flavors. Will definitely buy again! I tried this on a coupon, but ive been buying this brand for years, and will continue to buy."

16_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,It brought me back to childhood with 2 great cookies
17_breyers,2,5.0,0.0,"I was so hopeful when I bought this new Bryers flavor, but what a disappointment. It’s mostly vanilla with Caramel whispered across the top. Also, the vanilla didn’t taste like the original vanilla bean ice cream that put Bryers on the map. More Caramel please!!"
17_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,YUMMY!! perfect combination of vamilla and caramel. Just enough caramel sprinkled thru-out so as to not overwhelm. It is not a vanilla sundae with caramel topping..it is a mixture of both. PERFECTION!!
17_breyers,3,3.0,1.0,"Tastes OK, but doesnt have any real vanilla bean listed in the ingredients, even though specs of something are in the ice cream."
18_breyers,5,6.0,1.0,"I am not a huge fan of artificial caramel flavoring because it tastes too much like maple syrup, so I was a little skeptical when I grabbed this gelato. However, I love to try new things and I had never had gelato. I was not only pleasantly surprised, but also completely blown away by this sweet treat. The texture is smooth and creamy, not overly sweet on its own. Its not ice cold like ice cream, so its wonderful for sensitive teeth. The caramel has got real caramel flavor, none of that maple syrup flavor at all. The caramel shavings melt in your mouth and its a shame that I have already finished the top parts of the container and have none left! :) Overall, the Vanilla Caramel Gelato Indulgences was a fabulous treat and I cant wait to buy it again. I received a coupon from Influenster to try this product for free. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I branched out from my normal ice cream purchase to try something new. I didn’t have any expectations going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised by what I found! The gelato has a much creamier texture and a richer flavor. I really like the balance between the vanilla gelato and the caramel and chocolate sauce. The crunch on top is my favorite part! I do find, with how rich it is a smaller portion hits the sweet spot much quicker. I really like that Brewers ingredients make it a no brainer when sharing with my kids. The no nonsense, real ingredients give me confidence in letting my kids indulge along with me. I received the product free of charge via Influenster to test and review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.n"
18_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"This is only my 2nd time trying gelato & Im wondering why I dont eat it more! So creamy & smooth. It is a little rich, so the size it comes in is perfect!"
18_breyers,5,13.0,5.0,"There is something very wrong with these gelatos. I kept tasting it over and over trying to decipher what the problem was. Then, after I bought another container, a friend was over and I brought the container out- telling her there was something wrong with this gelato stuff. I gave her a spoon. We sat opposite each other taking spoonful after spoonful, savoring each bite but decidedly trying to find out why it was so delicious, different and unstoppable; right up to finishing the container in that sitting, we couldnt find the answer. We have to keep eating this until we figure it out"
18_breyers,5,14.0,5.0,What can I say about Breyers Vanilla Caramel Gelato Indulgences besides it being delizioso! Im a huge Breyers Tiramisu Gelato fan. It is my most favorite desert item in the freezer aisle so I have to admit that I havent bother trying any of the other flavors. The vanilla caramel is almost as good. But as you can see in the picture its half empty. I was planning on taking a picture of it when it was full but my husband got to it before I could. He definitely places this in his number one spot. We love the lightness and rich flavors. We finished the whole container in one sitting. It was really hard to put the spoon down. Being that I am 9 months pregnant this gelato was an awesome late at night desert fix. I will stocking up.
18_breyers,5,5.0,1.0,"i have been an ice cream lover for as long as I can remember, and am quite fussy about my selection, i have to say this is the best product Ive come across, and I crave it non-stop, the texture and flavors are perfect, I just thanked my girlfriend for discovering this for me, thank you for making me fat and happy!"
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I couldnt wait to try the new Brewers Gelato and was pleasantly surprised when I did. I went for the vanilla caramel and was eager to see just how different it was compared to the others on the market. It was smooth and rich tasting. Not fake tasting and no aftertaste. Truly such a delight! Soothed my sweet tooth and was very filling! The only thing is I noticed that the packaging was small (as all Breyer products are) compared to the other ice cream and gelato that I usually buy
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"There are many ice cream products out there, and it is hard to know what to try and what will be good. Dont waste your time and get right to trying Breyers Gelato. It is such a treat and it transforms you like you are somewhere else. I feel like I was eating ice cream at a stand rather than from my freezer. The blend of the caramel with the vanilla is just right and makes it sweet but not too sweet. I would suggest you go to the store and get this right away!"
18_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,I buy 4 vanilla caramel gelato a week. Its great! Can I get some coupons?
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Better than any ice cream product than ice ever tasted! Im not usually a fan of ice cream, Ill eat it but I dont go out of my way to purchase it. However, the Vanilla Caramel Gelato is simply so darn good that if one grocery store is sold out, Ill go to another until I find it. There are no words to adequately describe this delicious indulgence. Try it, and you will be hooked just like me."
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Brewers gelato is one of my favorite frozen treats! It is silky smooth and has a great taste. It was super easy to scoop out, even right from the freezer. The flavor I had had thick swirls of caramel that melted in my mouth and perfectly portions chocolate bits on top. The gelato itself had a perfectly balanced flavor that made it a nice treat. A small portion is perfect for an anytime snack."
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This gelato is soooo smooth and creamy! My favorite part about it is the fact that it is not overly sweet... you can really enjoy the flavor, coolness and creaminess of the vanilla. My husband is a caramel fanatic so of course his favorite part is the thick caramel swirls. Im so happy I had the chance to try this and I will definitely be buying it in the future!"
18_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I recently tried Breyers Gelato and I am hooked! The soft, creamy texture and sweet caramel flavor were the perfect combination. This cool treat is so much more satisfying than ice cream. Think light, vanilla gelato with ribbons of caramel in every bite. Mmmmm, the perfect after dinner dessert. I couldnt dream up a better flavor combination."
18_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,Why did you discontinue the chocolate caramel gelato? Why???? Why??????? Bring it back!!!!
19_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Based on the picture and description, I was expecting two colors of ice cream. Mine it ALL chocolate and absolutely no mint. I even dug down to the bottom to see if by chance it didnt get swirled and the mint was stuck at the bottom. No luck. It looked nothing like the picture. I feel better after seeing Im not imagining things when I saw others have had the same problem. Not sure what happened, but there appears to be a serious problem with this particular flavor. I will send something to the customer service email listed in the other reviews. The chocolate ice cream is really good, but I wanted chocolate and mint."
19_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I purchased this flavor wanting chocolate Mint Ice Cream, there was NO mint in this ice cream whatsoever! Looking at the ingredient list on the side, I noticed it doesnt even list mint. It was chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips only! Whats up with that Breyers?"
19_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"I love Breyers and the Mint Choc Chip is one of my favorites. The minty flavor cleanses the palate with the chocolate chips giving just enough to balance it without affecting the flavor. I saw the new Chocolate Mint Ice Cream flavor on the shelf and decided to try it. Its horrid. Theres hardly a hint of mint, but the chocolate is as strong and present as regular chocolate icecream. And I see so many choc varieties that6 it6 seems sometimes that chocolate is all there is. So thanks, but No Thanks. Ill stick with the Mint Chocolate Chip because if it has something that this new flavor doesnt have, its a mint flavor."
19_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream taste like regular chocolate ice cream. There is BARELY any peppermint flavor. You can NOT taste it unless you only eat the white mint part of the ice cream, which there is very little of. If you ask me replace the chucks of chocolate with crushed up peppermint and intensify the peppermint flavor/add more of the white mint part to balance out the chocolate. I was looking forward to trying this product but I am absolutely UNIMPRESSED!!! Personally I love chocolate but the flavor was way too strong to be considered “peppermint hot chocolate” I know you can do better Breyers. "
19_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I have been a Breyers ice cream fan since I was a little girl, 30+ years. My favorite has always been Mint Chocolate Chip. However, that changed last week. I took a leap of faith when I saw the Chocolate Mint and gave it a try. I was not disappointed! This ice cream has the best of both worlds. The mint is more subtle because of the rich dark chocolate. I now have a new favorite!"
19_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Havent had any problems like the other reviewers, I feel sorry for them as it has become our only ice cream BUT Hubby and I can not find it anymore.have been buying it out everywhere its still on the shelf the last few months, but no one seems to have it in stock...Now Im sad and down to just one carton in the freezer... Dear Breyers where are you selling it??"
19_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"This is my new favorite Breyers flavor. It is 2 delicious ice creams combined to create a blend any one who likes chocolate and mint together will enjoy. Is it as minty as their mint chocolate chip? No, because its half dark Chocolate as well. so dont expect the overwhelming mint from the regular mint chocolate chip ice cream."
19_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I was a huge fan of Hagendaze Chocolate Chocolate Mint. I was very disappointed when it was discontinued years ago and had not found a replacement until now! I find this has the right amount of mint, chips and chocolate. Thank you!"
19_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This is one of Breyers best! Yes, the mint flavor is more subdued than their regular chocolate mint, and I like that one too, but Im also a chocoholic and I love this twist on the chocolate and mint flavors!"
20_breyers,1,18.0,3.0,"I am SO disappointed. I went to this website to find out who sold Breyers Peach Ice cream in my area. I was referred to Walmart. I found the Breyers products...and to my chagrin, the""peach"" carton says ""frozen dairy desert,"" but not ICE CREAM! This means that the product does not meet the legal standards required for something to be sold as Ice Cream, and it also means that Breyers has lost another customer. I long for the days when Breyers was made in Philadelphia, and everything was top notch. The Vanilla had REAL Vanilla beans in it. I concur with the other reviews. This does not even BEGIN to be Peach Ice Cream if it cant even BE Ice Cream!!!!!"
20_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,Called and they said we no longer have Peach Ice Cream and was unable to tell me what other products where no longer ICECREAM as they had to many ( its the ICECREAm line and even looking on the website it looks to be very few that are ICECREAm though they included the peach in the non gmo and classic but its still not ICECREAM. Lost a buyer - going back to the only other company I do buy. and by the way this peach stuff is SO SWEET ..leaves a weird taste and not that much peach flavor or chunks or peach witch all that made me stop go read the carton and go what the heck?
20_breyers,5,10.0,3.0,"Breyers Peach Ice Cream is the best, no one makes it better than Breyers, no one. Asking others if theyve ever had Breyers Peach Ice Cream is one of my favorite conversation starters, and to this day, everyone has the same reaction, their face lights up, and with eyes wide open, they say, ""Oh-My-Gosh!, I Love Breyers Peach Ice Cream!"" Conversation continues with them saying such things as, ""Do you have some?"", ""Breyers Peach is the only ice cream Ill eat"", ""Theres nothing better then Breyers Peach Ice Cream"", ""Breyers Peach Ice Cream is heaven on earth"". And yes, it is heavenly!"
20_breyers,1,33.0,2.0,"What happened to the Peach Breyers Ice Cream???? It used to be so much thick, now its like eating whip cream with peaches in it. The sweetened taste is sweetener, you could taste it. Disheartening, this ice cream isnt the same, its not sold as half a gallon anymore, only as 1.5 Quarts. They lost a customer."
20_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I grew up in a small town near a peach and other produce packing house. I can assure you that this isnt real peach ice cream. Im from Peach County Ga. You couldnt sell a drop of this trash anywhere near there. They dont even attempt to sell it in stores there. I moved out to Seattle and this is the garbage that people call peach ice cream. If you would really like real peach ice cream find a peach packing house. The chunks of orange stuff in it taste nothing like any peach Ive ever tasted and Ive eaten thousands. It is the worst ice cream I have ever had. I better not try anything new they make. Stick with the basics.
20_breyers,2,16.0,1.0,"I know it was peach because it said so on the carton, but you couldnt tell it by the taste. I can remember when you could think you were in the orchard"
20_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"I want to start off by saying I’m a die hard peach fan. I live in the peach state and know peach ice cream, and I hate to say it but this is the worst peach ice cream I have ever tried. Living in Georgia and being raised around peach orchards I have experienced great tasting peaches. The peaches y’all use in your ice cream need to be given more time to ripen the more they ripen the sweeter the ice cream will turn out. Surprisingly the better the peach flavor will be."
20_breyers,1,8.0,0.0,This product is horrendous. Breyers peach ice cream used to be amazing...now it has the consistency of shaving cream. it is garbage.
20_breyers,1,6.0,0.0,"Where are all the ""mouth watering"" peaches? This is little more than peach flavored vanila ice cream. Sorry. Make that frozen dairy dessert. Who came up with that? The same people that dreamed up a ""pasteurized cheese (flavored) product? Loved it when Bryers made ice cream."
20_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"I was excited to enjoy Breyers Peach Ice cream. When I tasted it I was surprised it did not have that authentic Breyers taste. Yes it was smooth but in had a foamy consistency, unlike the original vanilla which has a pure creaminess. The peach taste like the less expensive ice creams. The peaches were plentiful and fresh. Nice. Why did you have to ruin it with corn syrup and less than 2% or less of Vegetable Gums, Guar, Mono and Diglycerides. Granted, things cost more however those ingredients cost as well. Save your money and stick to ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS PLEASE. I have enjoyed Breyers since a child and remember THE GOOD BREYERS. The way to compete and win is to remain Authentic When we know better, we do better. Do Better Breyers like the Good ole Authentic days. Thank you for this forum.."

20_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I have always been a huge fan of Breyer’s Ice cream my spouse buys a different brand. I was in the store and picked up vanilla and my all time favorite peach. What have you done to the ice cream? It is awful. It does not taste the same. It is not nearly as creamy or delicious. It taste like an off brand copycat. I might as well buy a store brand. You have lost a customer. Vanilla is just as awful.
20_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"Breyers peach USED to be natural and had a homemade consistency. This used to be a great natural ice cream, now its foamy, and gummy. A shame."

21_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,i usually like Breyers ice cream but was sorely disappointed in this flavor. the Chocolate flavor was gritty and off tasting. the vanilla ice cream surrounding it was also off. This is the second time I have bought this flavor thinking something was wrong with the batch. but it seems to be the Flavor itself.
21_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream has been my favorite since the first time I tried it! The vanilla and fudge balance each other perfectly and just taste phenomenal.

With this new recipe change that uses sorbitol and maltodextrin, both high-glycemic ingredients, and the almost double net carb increase, I am no longer able to eat it. In addition, I thought the former Carbsmart formula tasted much better. Many, many people on the low carb forums are writing about this. Please bring back the old formula. If cost is a factor, I know that many of us would be willing to pay a little more for a specialty ice cream."

Used to be ""milk and cream"" and now its water and chemicals ! Shame on you. Never buying it again. BEWARE !!"
22_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,First of all not sure how people are saying there are 18 carbs in the ice cream. To get the correct carb count you have to subtract the fiber and alcohol sugars from the carbs and that is the true carb count. Just wish there were more flavors 
22_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This ice cream is amazing!!! I have lost 23 lbs eating a low carb diet. I never would’ve been able to do this without this chocolate ice cream! I love the vanilla also.

22_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Very sad was always buying it at my local Walmart kept waiting for the store to fill the shelf with the ice cream. Asked the manager and was told they cant even order it. What gives? Too much sugar choices very few low carb products to buy. Obesity is a problem and looks like Walmart doesnt care.

23_breyers,5,6.0,1.0,"First I had Carb Smart Vanilla--I thought I died and went to heaven. Then I tried the chocolate and fell totally in love with the chocolate. Now I can join the family for dessert and I actually have a choice of which Carb Smart flavor to have. And then, my husband brought home Carb Smart Peanut butter by accident (the picture looks a lot like vanilla if you dont look carefully) and I was totally hooked--it is sublime! Please dont make a mint chocolate chip with Hersheys sugar free chocolate morsels. You may find me hidden away in a dark closet with a container of Carb Smart mint chocolate chip and a big spoon. I would be rendered helpless!"
23_breyers,1,13.0,0.0,"Was very excited when I saw this new flavor as I love peanut butter ice cream. Texture / mouth feel was fantastic. Very creamy, much more than what I expected from a low carb ice cream. However I found the flavor extremely lacking, the ice cream was very bland and had little to no peanut butter flavor. There was a small swirl of peanut butter in the container however it was way too small for the size of the container and many scoops of ice cream had no peanut butter swirl at all. Will not buy again."
23_breyers,1,24.0,0.0,"Id buy six or eight cartons of this every single time I saw it on the shelves. Im not joking when I say that this wonderful treat made my first year as a diabetic bearable, and helped me get my AC-1 down to 5. It was as good as any real ice cream, with those thick, salty swirls of peanut butter blending so perfectly with the sweet, slightly peanut buttery ice cream. Well, the swirl is gone and Im devastated. My favourite treat is dead! I couldnt believe my eyes when I scooped into my new carton and found it uniform. The sweetness and subtle flavour that blended so well with those yummy swirls is just painfully generic on its own. Less flavour than Vanilla. Ill be switching to another brands no sugar added options until the swirls come back. Cant describe how disappointed I am. There are so few options as a diabetic and the old recipe was such a standout. Now? Not so much."

The last few cartons that I have purchased no longer have the peanut butter swirl that gave it its wonderful flavor. The last several cartons are tasteless...no peanut butter flavor and no swirls. I can’t imagine why you would change something that was perfect. I’m sad to say that you’ve lost a customer."
23_breyers,1,45.0,0.0,"We were buying the Peanut Butter flavor six at a time. It WAS really good with the large swirls & chunks of Peanut Butter. They changed the recipe and removed all of the swirls. Now it tastes very bland and a little like cardboard. WHY did you do it Breyers, WHY?"
23_breyers,1,8.0,0.0,"Like all the other recent reviews, this ice cream is not the same. This was a poor choice on someones part. Tastes exactly like the vanilla now. I finished a box that said it expires in July of 2020 and it was perfect. The next box expires April of 2021and it was terrible. I assume this new change allows the product to last twice as long. It will have to because Im not gonna eat it unless I really get desperate."

About 5 or 6 months ago I started noticing that the ribbons of peanut butter were missing. I wasnt sure if it was a production error or a change in the recipe but It was vary disappointed in the change. Although I continued to purchase the product, it wasnt until last week I that I noticed the ribbons of peanut butter had suddenly reappeared. I want to thank whoever was responsible for this because I just love the taste and texture and will continue to promote this excellent product."

23_breyers,1,11.0,0.0,My husband and I were buying these 4 at a time & were really enjoying UNTIL they removed the peanut butter swirl! WHY change the recipe Breyers? Clearly based on these posts everyone liked the swirl. Please bring the swirl back or we will stop buying!
23_breyers,1,11.0,0.0,I loved the peanut butter because it had.... PEANUT BUTTER. Now there’s nothing and it’s lost it’s taste. What a pure disappointment. I’m sure someone high up thought removing the best part was a good idea and sadly I’m sure they still have a job.
23_breyers,2,10.0,0.0,It was a great surprise when I first discovered the CarbSmart PB flavor at my store in addition to Vanilla and Chocolate.

It’s tricky to blend though, so this was like a dream come true! Well, Dream shattered! This tastes like dirt. Or more accurately, it tastes like wet cardboard smells! The peanut butter swirl is okayish but the ice cream flavor is awful. Why not just add a peanut butter swirl to the already delish vanilla?! Ugh. Just not good. So disappointed."

23_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"To say that my husband and I loved Carb Smart Peanut butter ice cream is a understatement!! The swirls were so heavenly running through it. I would buy 6 to 8 cartons at a time. Then the last I bought had no swirls! I was stuck with 8 containers of bland,tasteless cream that we couldnt even tell it had a flavor at all. Why did you do this to your loyal customers? Diabetics are deprived already with very few good choices! Please,please fix it and give us more flavor! Thanks!!"
23_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"The first time I got this was because I wanted to try the new flavor and mix it with the chocolate. It was great!

I feel like I was duped into buying if when it first came out only to be disappointed on the repeat purchase. Please bring back the original version with real peanut butter! Thanks."
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Why Breyers why?? The peanut butter WAS the best thing to happen for low carb dieters in awhile! That is, until you changed it for absolutely no reason. It has no peanut butter flavor now and I’m so disappointed that I just bought my regular stockpile of 6. Yuck. Change it back! Also bring back butter pecan."
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This used to be my favorite ice cream until recently I bought a container of it and the swirls of peanut butter inside were completely missing. I cant imagine who in the chain of command thought this would be a great idea but I wont be buying it again. Note to Breyers: google Hostess Suzy Q debacle.
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,The Peanut Butter was my favorite flavor and we would go out of our way to purchase it from the one store that carried it. The new recipe is awful. Why get rid of the swirl? It is bland and flavorless now and lost the additional appeal of the swirl texture. Very disappointed with this change.
23_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Much like many others, I was absolutely in love with this ice cream, as were my parents. Both me and my mom would regularly buy multiple cartons at a time because we loved the creamyness of the ice cream mixed with the tougher texture and stronger flavor of the peanut butter swirls. When we found some cartons without the swirls and just containing a plain cube of ice cream with a dull flavor, we both just prayed that it was an older recipe and the newer ones contained the swirls because Breyers understood it was an improvement. I am truly baffled to find out that the plain cartons were the new recipe. Just why? Its painfully boring now. I still buy them on the off chance I get one with swirls, which is easily a no-brainer 5-star ice cream. Hopefully they come to their senses and revert the horrible mistake theyve made."
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Came here to voice my dissatisfaction with everyone else. Bring back the previous formulation for 5 stars. Currently tastes like vanilla with a hint of peanut butter. Didn’t even finish the current gallon I have and will not ever purchase this current formulation again.
23_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Ive been purchasing & enjoying your delicious Carb Smart ice creams for some time now. Although the chocolate & vanilla are very good, the Peanut Butter is far & away THE BEST! I recently bought a carton with no peanut butter swirl & at first I thought it was a mistake. Then I noticed your packaging changed as well - no swirl. So disappointing, flavor is poor without the best part. Why did you remove it? Please bring back the swirl!"
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This ice cream was the BEST low carb half gallon money could buy.......UNTIL they took out the Peanut Butter swirl!!! WHY!!??? If they dont add it back I am not going to buy it any more.....
23_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,The first time I bought this ice cream I thought it was fantastic...because it had the peanut butter swirl. I occasionally buy Rebel low carb ice cream but I bought the Brewers this time because it was on sale. As soon as I took the first scoop I was wondering where the peanut butter swirl was. It does not taste like peanut butter and I won’t buy this again. Obviously everyone else here is missing the peanut butter swirl again.
23_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This is not very tasty. There is an odd taste that isnt like l peanut butter. Too creamy

I then saw on Breyers website their vanilla and chocolate and bought a container of the chocolate. It is awesome and compares to Blue Bell dutch chocolate, but is lactose free. Thank you Breyers from a lover of ice cream. Told wife to get two containers of chocolate and vanilla tomorrow."

Thank you so much for this product!
24_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,I enjoy eating this ice cream. I only hope that you would make lactose free ice cream sandwiches. I feel at a disadvantage because every novelty type ice cream is regular. Also the little cups of individual servings.

Our family of 7 would definitely recommend Breyers ice cream!"
25_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,I already buy the Neapolitan Breyers ice cream. I love it because it is not overly creamy. The strawberry doesnt taste fake and the three flavors together are great. I am very picky when it comes to my ice cream and would highly recommend this to everyone.

I looked at the ingredients and it was colored pink with beet juice and called strawberry. It is really gross. The picture on the carton was very deceiving, it showed strawberries in the ice cream and there are NO strawberries but it is called strawberry. In fact in the list of ingredients strawberry is not there???????? Very disappointed!"
25_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"To whom it may concern: It is with sadness that I find it necessary to write a letter to an ice cream company that has held a much favored standing among competing dairy businesses. I believed that your brand of frozen treat was very tasty at the least. We see that things have changed. First, we get less quality in your packaged ice cream. I just figured out that the rich taste is gone or there has been a chain of poorly mixed batches sold. Perhaps air or ice water was mixed into the box I bought. Second, we get less volume at higher cost. It looks as though you are doing us a favor by telling us, all over the box, how natural and GMO free it is. However, what ever your complements, we know you short us on weight, volume, and quality. I might just as well start buying the cheap brands, its all about the same. The box we bought was : Breyers - Vanilla Chocolate Strawberry (MADE WITH NON-GMO SOURCED INGREDIENTS) 67135154 67135152 67145142 F.

26_breyers,5,21.0,1.0,"Because I have an allergy to milk products, my dessert choices are limited. I was pleased to find this ice cream in my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at first because all the non-dairy desserts I had tried before were not that great. But wow, Breyers! This ice cream was absolutely amazing -- it was as creamy and delicious as regular ice cream. I think the almond milk in it gives it a subtle flavor that doesnt overpower the vanilla or peanut butter flavors. And I liked that this ice cream is made with natural ingredients. Thank you Breyers! I hope that youll continue to make this ice cream and add more flavors."
26_breyers,5,11.0,0.0,"Almond milk instead of dairy means a kinder product. Kinder to the cows, of course, but also to the environment and our health. As for taste, YUM! My husband, myself, and the kiddo got three spoons - one for each of us - and finished it together in one sitting. The peanut butter swirl was just right. Not overpowering or gummy. The plain vanilla part, by itself, was a bit bland but as its meant to be eaten with the peanut butter, just right when both are on the spoon! The texture would fool any creamy dairy lover. Cant tell the difference. All three of us agree there will be more of this in our future."

This is, by far, the best non-dairy ice cream. Its silky and creamy in texture and the flavor is simply that Breyers vanilla Ive always loved, swirled with ribbons of peanut butter. Not only is it delicious, but the ingredient list is short and sweet and completely recognizable. Thank you for making non-dairy additions to your product line! I hope to see more flavors (gluten-free as well, please!) in the future."

My daughter and I like Breyers Ice Cream, so we cant help sneaking a small bowl of dairy ice cream even though we know well pay for it. Now we get to have Breyers and feel great about eating it! The ice cream was very smooth, creamy and tasty. It scooped out easily. The only problem with it is that it was gone too soon! My husband found the container and finished it on us, Both my daughter and I have recommended the new non-dairy Breyers to other people we know with tummy troubles, but this is an ice cream that everyone can enjoy. Just ask my husband!"
26_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,Real excited to see your new peanut butter flavor nondairy ice cream in our store today. Its not my favorite flavor but it has an excellent vanilla base. (Glad youre not using coconut milk like so many others )I found the cookie and cream to be too sweet and not refreshing. Im hoping that you will try some more nondairy flavors. I would love to see a vanilla almond milk base with cherry and possibly vegan dark chocolate chunks… Breyers has always had the best vanilla and the best ice cream and I appreciate that you have not jacked up the price like other brands for nondairy ice cream! Thank you!
26_breyers,5,15.0,0.0,"My husband is allergic to gluten, dairy, soy, and rice. Therefore his desert options are limited. He has tried all of the non-dairy, gluten free, soy free options on the market. He likes a couple of them, but has said many times you can tell its not real ice cream. Also you only get a pint for around $6. BREYERS has beat all the competition in the non-dairy treat race...even Been and Jerrys (who puts soy in theirs). This ice cream is creamy and smooth, easy to scoop and absolutely delicious. Our son did not believe that it wasnt real dairy ice cream. Not only does it have the best flavor and texture, it also has the best price. A full quart for the same price as all the pints. Thank you BREYERS and please keep the non-dairy, gluten free, soy free ice cream ideas coming. More flavors please."
26_breyers,4,4.0,0.0,"Overall, I have to say that Breyers Nondairy Vanilla with peanut butter grozen dessert is very good. It has the same texture as a ""real"" ice cream. The peanut butter swirls flavor is excellent. However, the vanilla ice cream made from almond milk is overly sweet for my taste. In fact, my mom was there when I tried it and my first words were. ""Oh wow, thats really sweet."" And not in a good way. The peanut butter isnt very sweet though, so if you get a spoonful with both, its pretty tasty."
26_breyers,5,6.0,0.0,"As someone who loves ice cream, Im a hard sell on non-dairy frozen treats, but the Breyers Non-Dairy Vanilla Peanut Butter was delicious. The vanilla was at first bite a bit intense but it really mellowed with the peanut butter, which is actual peanut butter. It is extremely creamy and the consistency was just like regular ice cream. I will definitely be trying the other Breyers Non-Dairy flavor."

It doesn’t have an almond taste (the almond base is actually undetectable, unlike many other brands!) I would love to see more dairy free flavors, hopefully more gluten and dairy free ones (I have a lot of food allergies haha) this df ice cream made me want to cry, I’ve missed ice cream so much!!"

Having developed a milk allergy, I havent been able to eat ""normal"" ice cream for some time now (which growing up, I loved ice cream). I have tried many many maaaaaaany other options that just were not cutting my craving! Well.... Thank you Breyers for making something creamy and delicious that actually tastes like ice cream!"
26_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"The kids were a little Leary of ""non-dairy"" but I have to say that this Breyers non-dairy changed their minds. The texture was smooth, the flavor was fabulous and they had to admit that they really liked it! We definitely would try it again!"
26_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Most almond milk ice creams are expensive and have more of an icy texture. This is smooth, creamy and really good. I wish they had more flavors, as Im also gluten free and have only tried the peanut butter. I will be getting more!"
26_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"The flavor overall was pretty good. A little sweeter than I like for myself, but my kids enjoyed it. My oldest liked it the first night and then said he didnt. I think that was because he read the label and of course if it is healthy or good for him, he does not like it anymore! Lol My two younger one finished off the container without any problem! :) If my regular non dairy brand was not avalible, I would pick this up as an alternative!"
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Can I tell you that eating Breyers nondairy ice cream is by far amazing you cannot tell that is no dairy in it. we had cake and ice cream for my coworkers at my job so we all decided to try Breyers nondairy ice cream and I had no complaints everybody said that it was actually going to go by it because a couple people have children that are lactose intolerant so I think its amazing that exact, with this ice cream and it is very tasty."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I became lactose intolerant about 8 years ago. And recently in the past 2 years have gone Vegan. Finding ice cream that taste like the ice cream I have bought in the past was a challenge. I have tried just about every non daily ice cream you can buy, and this is the closest to dairy ice cream I can find. Peanut Butter with a banana cut up is ace. Hope to see more flavors available sometime. Thanks for making this."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,New product from Breyers dairy free ice cream in my opinion is just as good as their regular ice cream. I couldnt tell the difference it was just as creamy as the dairy version. I tried the peanut butter vanilla swirl and look forward to trying the other flavor Oreo cookies and cream. I appreciate the fact that they use recognizable ingredients and arent full of chemicals.
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I love the taste of this frozen dessert! The texture was silky smooth not chalky or icy like some non-dairy items. The peanut butter was delicious and just the right amount as to not overpower the base flavor. Please keep this item in high quantities at the local grocers as there was only one other container left after I purchased mine!
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I am really excited by the new non-dairy ice cream offerings by Breyers. Im on a dairy-free diet per doctors orders and I find it extremely difficult. I love cheese and ice cream. Ive tried dozens of non-dairy ice creams in the past and Im usually disappointed. Most non-dairy ice creams are overly sweet and not at all creamy. Ive even had some with a weird chemical aftertaste. Breyers non-dairy ice cream in the vanilla peanut butter flavor did not disappoint. The almond milk ice cream base was on point- nice and creamy, natural tasting, sweet vanilla flavor, but not overly sweet. The peanut butter was real as well which was a good salty balance to the sweet ice cream. Ill be honest, this ice cream would have been better with chocolate flavored ice cream because chocolate and peanut butter are a combo made in heaven. I am looking forward to trying the Oreo flavor next. I found my new ice cream- I couldnt be happier, especially for only 140 calories per serving."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I was looking for ice cream for my husband and on the Breyers last section my eyes opened wide seeing non-dairy, and u know what happened,it and up in my card,so good ,good ,good,now Im waiting for coffee flavored please or some others"
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"By far the best frozen desert. Nothing else I can add. Just wish they had more flavors. Since I cannot have dairy or gluten, the peanut butter vanilla is my only option. Superb, flavor and texture. Excellent value. Bravo."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"We are gluten, dairy and soy free. This product is exceptional. Tastes like what I remember ice cream tasted like 15 years ago. Looking forward to more flavor additions in the future. Thank you, Breyers!"
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"When I tried this, it was like no other dairy free ice cream Ive had. It was amazingly delicious! The consistency and taste seemed so close to real ice cream. Even my dairy kids love this ice cream."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This dairy free icecream is unbelievable. I would not know the difference taste side from their other dairy Ice cream. So excited! Cant wait for more flavors to come out. Way to go Breyers
26_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Loved the taste of this Non-Dairy Vanilla Peanut Butter. You could tell it was made with Almond Milk, but that just added to the flavor. It was nice and rich and very simple ingredients."
26_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This ice cream is incredible, do you have plans for more flavours that are both dairy & gluten free? Its easily scoopable and very flavourable"
27_breyers,5,12.0,0.0,"I love Breyers Gelatos; this flavor is probably my third favorite (?). Im not a cheesecake fan, but this is so creamy delicious and the raspberry sauce? YOWZA! Not to mention the graham cracker sprinkles, and I dont even like Graham crackers ether. Go figure? But best of all, for some reason, I can eat Breyers gelatos (a reasonable amount) before bedtime, and they dont mess with my sinuses like ice cream does - YEAH! GO Breyers GO!!!"

27_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"Breyers Raspberry Cheesecake Gelato Indulgences is a great combination of silky smooth gelato with raspberry sauce swirls and graham cracker crumbs. When it softens just a bit, I could eat the whole plastic container full! It is so much better than ice cream. It tastes pure and yummy! I would LOVE to try the other eleven flavors of Breyers Gelato to see if they are also so devine!"
27_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I love this!! This is my first gelato and I was skeptical. It was for my fiance but I had to try it and as far as he knows this is my special ice cream. It is so rich and silky. I dont totally taste cheesecake bufthe richness and texture scream cheesecake. The raspberry isnt overpowering and the graham cracker is the perfect touch. Im in love
27_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,I really wanted to try this raspberry cheesecake gelato but when I got home I noticed there was no freshness seal. So there was no way I could tell if the product was tampered with or not. In this day & age you have to be careful if there is no seal from a safety standpoint I would not buy this product for that reason alone
27_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,While I love the Raspberry cheesecake it is the best bite while with the crumbs. With that being said it needs to have some within so you get it in every bite!
28_breyers,1,9.0,0.0,"I love Reese’s so I was excited to try this ice cream. I was so disappointed upon trying it that I had to throw it away. I tried searching through the entire carton and found around 10 small Reese’s cup pieces. At that point you shouldn’t even be able to call it Reese’s ice cream. It’s just peanut butter ice cream. I mean they aren’t lying on their packaging though, when they say 35% more peanut butter cups. 35x0 is still 0...."
28_breyers,2,14.0,1.0,"My favorite ice cream flavor is anything with peanut butter cups! I thought I would try this one, and what a disappointment it was. I dont know what the base is. Its not chocolate. Its not vanilla, and its not peanut butter (or at least, doesnt taste like any of them). I dont know WHAT it is! But it tasted ""okay"". Then I began to indulge. At the beginning of the ice cream, you get some chunks of what I think are chocolate pieces, and maybe some small pieces of peanut butter cups. But it seems to be a bit skimpy. So about half way through, I decided to melt it down so I can see just how much ""blast"" is actually in it. And I found NONE! I found not ONE SINGLE peanut butter cup or chocolate chunk! NADA! So in addition to a ""weird"" ice cream base, it is very skimpy on the ""blast"" part. It would be so much better with a vanilla base ice cream, and MORE PBCs!!! Since I was so disappointed in it, I wont be buying it again. And by the way, why the heck do you need to know how old I am, what my gender is, etc? Stop asking personal questions! Or at the very least, make those ""optional"" questions. Lynn"
28_breyers,2,3.0,1.0,I was expecting more after seeing 35% more Reeses pieces. Instead I received 100% less!
28_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I had a great experience the first time I had this flavor ice cream so I didnt even think twice about getting it again. This time was completely different. I wish I was exaggerating when I say there were NO reeses peanut butter cup pieces. None whatsoever. I kept digging and digging around and nothing! Super disappointed, especially since the packaging claims there is ""35% more peanut butter cup pieces."" Thats definitely false and super misleading. There were gobs of chocolate sauce which over powered the peanut butter flavor of ice cream. Probably not getting this flavor again."
28_breyers,1,5.0,2.0,"I was really looking forward to this ice cream, especially being a product of Breyers as their ice cream in the past was good. I was expecting the ice cream to taste like the peanut butter of an actual resees cup but definitely did not. As a matter of fact, no taste of peanut butter. What a disappointment and will never waste my money on this product. Breyers, to me, this is false advertisement. After reading the reviews, it seems as tho most people feel the same. What a shame!"
28_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,I brought what I thought was Breyers Reese ice cream. Turns out not be ice cream at all but a sugar laden concoction that was super sweet and not very good at all. This will be the last time I ever buy a Breyers product again.. I dumped most of it down the garbage disposal..
28_breyers,1,6.0,3.0,"Misleading packaging, no reeses peanut butter cups whatsoever. Ice cream is blandly flavored with the odd tiny piece of chocolate, and streaks of some sort of fudge flavoring that I cant even call fudge, because that would be ok tasting. What a disappointment, dont waste your money on this product; PC brand peanut butter cup ice-cream is 10 times better, and actually HAS the peanut butter cups shown on the packaging."
28_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"If you’re looking for lifeless, lackluster chocolate ice cream this is the best choice for you! It will leave your mouth cold, frustrated, and dissatisfied as you search in vain for any peanut butter flavor whatsoever. I am disgusted. I am distraught. I am disappointed past articulation. Please save yourself this sorrow."
28_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I was *so* looking forward to this special treat after seeing one of my old favorite ice creams from long ago now had peanut butter cup flavor. Unfortunately, not only did this not live up to expectations, it was rather awful-- sickeningly sweet, to the point of leaving an aftertaste, and not at all creamy-- rather water in fact. I checked the box and it became obvious why-- the ingredients are mainly milk and corn syrup and various gums now. The only cream is way down at the end of the list after a dozen different versions of sugar and corn syrup. And its not even called ice cream anymore-- its a ""frozen dairy dessert"". There werent any sizeable chunks of peanut butter cups to make eating the marshmallow-like base at all enjoyable either. I dont eat ice cream very often anymore, but when I do Im going to think twice before picking Breyers after this experience. At the very least, Ill need to read the box carefully from now on-- something I didnt have to worry about with Breyers many years ago."
28_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"This cured me of my weakness for ice cream, sorry, frozen dairy dessert. Tastes like peanut butter flavored marshmallow. Frozen Cool Whip is closer to ice cream than this. Food science has failed us all and Reeses, youve made a huge mistake putting your name on this."
28_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I was so excited to try this! Who doesn’t love Reese’s? The ice cream itself was very bland and barely had any peanut flavor. There was barely any Reese’s cups in the entire carton and the “fudge swirl” was very underwhelming. Will not buy again.
28_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This Ice Cream is AMAZING. My brother and I eat a container in one serving half for him and half for me.We go trlhrough at least 2 containers a day except when we buy the stores out of stock. Im truly addicted to this product. It is loaded with chunks of Reeses and the ice cream is peanut butter flavored. Its the best ice cream ever made and we will be lifetime customers. Keep up the good work BREYERS WE ARE YOUR #1 CUSTOMERS.
28_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,Was so excited for this ice cream and was super bummed out when I only had a few Reese’s mixed in the whole carton. The fudge swirl helped with the flavor but I was missing the star of dessert.
28_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"My kids loved the ice cream. However, I didnt feel the same way. I thought it was way too sweet. I only tried one bowl of it and thats all I could handle. It did have plenty of Reeses chunks in it but I think the ice cream part of it could have been better. It just didnt taste smooth and creamy like most ice cream does. I did receive the product free for a review."
29_breyers,5,16.0,1.0,"This is what I call incredible! The ice cream is soft and is easy to scoop out. It has Reeses Pieces and Reeses cups in a chocolate peanut butter ice cream. Whoever came up with this need to pay raise! It is the best of both worlds! The only thing I would add is chocolate sauce. Although, it is good right out of the tub as well."
29_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this the perfect combination of chocolate , peanut butter, and ice cream so if you love peanut butter pick this up to try"
29_breyers,1,7.0,3.0,"The ice cream tastes good, but is almost all peanut butter & looked nothing like the picture. And we only found 1 mini Reece’s Pieces candy in the entire container! There were chunks of peanut butter cup throughout. Waste of $6, won’t be buying this again!"
29_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,This was so delicious and perfect after a day playing in the sun and water. My kids loved it and wanted to know when I was going to get more! #influenster #complimentary #breyers
29_breyers,1,10.0,6.0,"I recently purchased the new 2-in-1 Reeses pieces and Reeses cup ice cream. I was very excited to try this. Half chocolate and half peanut butter ice cream with my 2 favorite peanut butter candies. Upon opening, I noticed that the chocolate ice cream was missing. After some digging, I was able to find a sliver of chocolate. Very sad to say there was no increase in the chocolate ice cream as I got to the bottom. Also the peanut butter ice cream tasted like it was watered down. Disappointing. I will not buy this again."
29_breyers,1,7.0,1.0,"I was six excited because I love chocolate and peanut butter. And I LOVE Reese’s Pieces. But you know when you make the mistake of buying baking candies, & they’re so tiny that the filling is barely there and the shell doesn’t taste the same?!?! I wish they would’ve just crunched up actual Reese’s pieces and cups and added them to regular chocolate ice cream & peanut butter swirl ice cream. The chocolate ice cream had so little flavor, it tasted watered down. That was a first. Usually it’s creamy & rich. Nope, it almost tasted like a knock off version of chocolate ice cream. So sad!"
29_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,"I got this ice cream because we love peanut butter, and this was a win. First thing I noticed when I opened it up was the big chunks of Reeses peanut butter cups. There were a lot of reeses pieces as well. The ice cream itself was a perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter flavors. They were separated enough where I could eat each flavor somewhat separately or spoon them together for that chocolate with peant butter taste. It was great. The big chunks of Reeses with the pieces was an awesome addition. I felt like a kid, picking them out. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As a chocolate and peanut butter fan, I will definitely be getting this again."
29_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"It looked like the best of both worlds, I was so excited to combine my favorite things, it looked awesome! Then I open it up expecting to see chunks of deliciousness, but nothing. Maybe the chunks were just deeper in... so I dug... and dug... and dug. Nope, no chunks. I scooped up a big bowl hoping at least to enjoy delicious chocolate and peanut buttery ice cream, but the flavors were a little muted and watery. I saw other reviews with pictures of delicious chunks and others seemed to think it tasted good. I want to try it again, but I don’t want to waste money on another flop :("
29_breyers,1,15.0,3.0,"Will not buy this again. Not one mini peanut butter cup, and very few Reese’s pieces. Would’ve been better off buying generic store brand."
29_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"My hubs and and I are avid ice cream fans so this VoxBox was right up our alley. We agreed on the bp cups and bp pieces 2 in 1 because we are also avid bp/chocolate combination fans. This ice cream was amazing! It is already about half gone, between my husband, myself and our two-year old (who, by the way, has inherited our love of ice cream). I strong suggest this ice cream flavor for any occasion, or simply to have on hand; especially if you love peanut butter cups and pieces."
29_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,What a disappointment! I bought this expecting it to be as described - my container was all peanut butter ice cream. No peanut butter cups in the ice cream either! The chocolate ice cream with the Reese’s pieces was also missing :-(
29_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,More pb&Reese cup than chocolate and reeses pieces. This is my 2nd container and only seems to be getting worse! Taste good but should of been equal parts. Now Im out of the reeses pieces.
30_breyers,5,8.0,0.0,This is awesome...Im a weight watcher and there is only 7 smart pts. per cup. Will keep this in my freezer all the time for a treat. Breyers never disappoints!!

30_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Oh my! I couldn’t stop eating this ice cream, I had to control myself. It’s not overly sweet, it has a great balance of sweet and salty. I got some salty notes and sweet creamy vanilla notes and oh my word it was a perfect combo. I love Splenda because it doesn’t have a weird after taste. This will be one of my favorites."
30_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I have tried a lot of no sugar, low calorie items and this stuff is amazing. I would take it over the regular stuff. I highly recommend. It’s even good to give to kids so cut back on the sugar."

31_breyers,4,5.0,1.0,I went to the store looking for the Snickers and M&M 2in1 but my Walmart was all out so I settled for the Snickers and boy am I happy! The ice cream was a nice texture and there was just enough snickers chucks for my liking! I would totally purchase again!
31_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I hate to give this delicious ice cream a bad review! But as my cravings kicked in tonight I ventured off to the local and nearest smiths drug store to pick up some of this great stuff..... I get home excited as ever for some movies and ice cream I use my teeth rip open the tub and begin. I’m going along tasting wonderful notes of vanilla and caramel awaiting the crunch of the that great candy and what happens next NO snickers ! In the 10% more container not one bit of snickers candy...this was a weird tub!
31_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,The reviews that give this product 5 stars appear to be fake. The snickers pieces are so finely blended you dont really taste anything other than vanilla ice cream. Its a shame. If you want snickers just eat a snickers.
31_breyers,1,7.0,4.0,"This isnt even real ice cream - its light ice cream. Mars should never have licensed this. Besides, it doesnt even remotely taste like a Snickers Bar."
31_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I absolutely love the snickers ice cream bars, so when I saw this I was hoping it would be something like that blended up. Instead it tastes nothing like snickers, and the light ice cream they have as a base is not good at all. Im honestly pretty disappointed."
31_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Not anywhere as good as other candy bar ice creams Ive tried. Taking it back for a refund!
32_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,I received this complimentary to review. I am currently eating this ice cream while I review it. I have been addicted to ice cream for like the past month to where I eat some almost every day! And this ice cream is delicious. I normally do not like crunchy things in it except for peanuts. I was hoping the peanut chunks were bigger like in a snickers bar. And I am not minding the crunchiness of the m&m’s. This was a perfect choice at the store because I wanted snickers and my son wanted a different flavor and we finally came together and decided on this. I recommend trying this if you haven’t yet.
32_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,My daughter absolutely went bonkers over this flavor. She kept saying she could really taste the snickers and mnms. I received this product free from @influenster as a trial but we will definitely be purchasing more in the future. Cant wait to check out other flavors.
32_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"The outside of the box makes it appear to have a strip of snickers in the middle with chocolate M&M on each side. Our box was 3/4 snickers and a very small 1/4 slice of chocolate M&M on one side! So small, we can barely see any chocolate!This ice cream is awful! Breyer’s ruined a great thing by getting rid of the chocolate M&M. Such a disappointment & will not purchase again!"
32_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"I received a complimentary coupon from influenster for testing purposes. I love things with nuts and so I jumped at the chance to try the Snickers/M&M 2 in 1 from Breyers. I tried it and the reason it gets a 4 star is only because Im not fond of the chocolate ice cream and M&M part... its ok I guess, not for me. The snickers part is delicious and I wish the whole ice cream tub was of snickers and caramel only. The pieces of snickers are amazing. I would definitely buy Breyers but not this 2 in 1... maybe one with just snickers."
32_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,I also got almost all snicker and no mini m and ms messed up :/. If you can make a mini m and ms ice cream all by itself please I would buy that.
32_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Unless your a chocolate lover this ice cream isnt for you well then again I can only write for myself and honestly the ice cream wasnt for me ( chocolate took control) and it is still in the deep freezer.
32_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,Love this ice cream. The only thing that would make it better would be more mini M&Ms.
32_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,I enjoyed this ice cream a lot. Both flavors were delicious! But the container I bought was almost all snickers ice cream. Id say it was about 1/4 the m&ms chocolate ice cream. Id recommend this ice cream but it would be a shame if it happened to that person too.
32_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,I didnt really enjoy the flavor. The caramel was too overpowering and it didnt taste enough like chocolate. Also we found a total of about 10 mini m&ms. Thats not nearly enough! I wouldnt buy this flavor again. But i would try the other flavors.
32_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I have tried all of the 2 in 1s and this is a favorite- i wish you guys would change up the combos- like snickers and reeses , reeses and kitkat, oreo and snickers, almond joy and anything :) totally would love that"

32_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I bought it because I like them both and I didnt know what to get. OMG. I was in heaven.
32_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream is so yummy. Love both flavors equally so it is quite a tasty treat
33_breyers,1,20.0,2.0,The bars are good but the carb content is now more than it was previously. As part of a low carb diet I would consume these as a treat. The packaging is very deceiving to those who bought them in the past. I bought some thinking it had 6 net carbs and realized it said 6 sugars. Which is way too many carbs. Equals out to be 9 or more per bar depending on which variety you get. I have switched to a different brand that offers lower net carbs. Was disheartened to see the way the packaging was so misleading. :(
33_breyers,2,48.0,5.0,"I have so looked forward to Breyers CarbSmart ice cream bars in the past. They were/are such a treat when watching net carbs, but now the net carbs of this Almond Bar (and their others as well) are greater than 8 carbs. Just way TOO MANY. Unfortunately, I will rarely be purchasing them after this. ***Please lower the net carb content. They are NO LONGER ""CarbSmart."""
33_breyers,5,22.0,0.0,"A diabetics delight. Low carbs, great taste. Scratches a big itch with no damage."
33_breyers,2,7.0,0.0,This product used to be great and tasted great. I am so disappointed you added sugar. Please change back to original product. I used to buy it all the time and loved it. I really will miss it but will no longer purchase. Too many concentrated carbs! Why?
33_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"We bought three boxes for the freezer and all of them are missing half the chocolate coating. Not sure what happened recently, usually they are fully coated like the picture on the box. They are usually very good."
33_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I have been a Breyers Carb Smart Vanilla bars and the Almond bars for a couple years I hate to say this out load but my husband and I would buy maybe 6 boxes a week but since you have changed what ever the contents of the bars I am no longer a fan. He does have a chemical taste now that I can not get past now. I have never written a review before on a item but this was my favorite at one time PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD ONE !!!
33_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,A very good low carb treat/dessert. Has a very good flavor!
33_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I loved these bars before the recent change in the recipe. It tasted as good as the high carb ice cream bars. Now, the ice cream tastes “watered down”...the rich, creamy flavor is gone. I won’t be purchasing anymore unless the old recipe is brought back."
33_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I just purchased the Almond Bars today and I was pretty excited. I usually stroll in the ice cream section for my kids and husband. I’ve been on Keto for almost a month (lost almost 15 pounds) and I always look for a low carb sweet treat. Other brands of low carb or high protein ice cream have too many carbs. And low carb desserts/bars have a weird aftertaste of what ever sweetener is being used. I’ve pretty much gone without a sweet treat, but since I’m a woman and am craving chocolate this week, I gave in. It was the best purchase today at the grocery store. It was the right portion, perfect sweetness and perfect amount of chocolate and almonds. If it had more almonds people, the carb count would go up! I can’t believe some of you think it has too many carbs. Go look at a regular ice cream bar with almonds. I’m sure it will shock you! I will definitely save my carbs for a special treat once or twice during the week. Having my almond cream cream bar tonight satisfied something that I guess was missing. Yeah, the meat and cheese can get old!!!"
33_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I’m a huge fan of these because the artificial sweetener taste is not very obvious and they are still made with real cream instead of some skim milk disaster that most of the other low carb bars are. The only snafu is that if you end up eating half a box of these you’ll still end up with a lot of carbs but one is pretty reasonable for dessert.
33_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,What a yummy treat. It is 5g of net carbs. Not 8 like some have stated. I don’t feel like this is a ridiculous amount as an occasional treat. The taste was excellent and very satisfying. Way better than I expected and didn’t really taste low carb. Would definitely buy again. Highly recommended.
33_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I had gotten used to weird substitutes for ice creams and treats while on Keto - but this one - I sort of cant believe its only 5 net carbs. Tastes close to what I remember a normal chocolate covered bar tasting like. Definitely enough for me to toss this into the rotation as a regular treat.
33_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I tried these bars for the first time last week and they are exactly what I need to give myself a keto friendly treat! I went back for more and they were totally sold out at my neighborhood store. They’re so amazing, get them while you can!"
33_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I bought 2 boxes of Carb Smart Almond bars and all 12 contents didnt have a single almond. It looks like just a vanilla bar dipped in chocolate. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
33_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,pretty delicious and has real chocolate cover ice cream flavor. So good I had to eat two! I will be buying it again. Recommend to others!
34_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Love Heath Bar! So I went with the Waffle Cone Heath Bar 2 in 1. Over all, the whole family was very pleased. The ice cream has a rich texture that cradles the candy pieces and it didnt separate from the candy like some brands. Great flavor combination, but I would have liked to see bigger chunks of Heath Bar. Other than that it was awesome! And it was free for my honest reveiw and testing.I would recommend you give it a try!"
34_breyers,1,9.0,1.0,"I have been a fan of Breyers since it was truly natural. Since I love Heath bar, I assumed it would good. In a word: AWFUL! It tastes like watered down Neapolitan without the strawberry with occasional unidentifiable brown crunchy things. I could not taste Heath bar at all. I threw it out."
34_breyers,1,10.0,2.0,"I have been a Breyers fan my whole life. In general I definitely prefer the ice creams over the frozen dairy desserts. After my sisters recommendation I found I loved the wafflecone but wished it was chocolate based. Since I like heathbars, and the wafflecone was in chocolate for the 2 in 1, I was very excited to try this product. Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing!!! 1.) The bits in the heath section were few and far between, and only about 10% of those bits had toffee... it was mostly just chocolate bits. It would have been a million times better for the heath to have been in a natural vanilla or vanilla bean base to help bring out the little toffee flavor there was. 2.) While I loved the wafflecone cone with the chocolate, the ratio in the container was about 85% vanilla heath to 15% chocolate wafflecone. I understand getting a 50/50 mix is probably too much to hope for, but it would have been nice if it was at least close. Bottom line.... Theres not much worse than wasting calories on mediocre ice cream. If I had wanted a carton of vanilla, I would have bought natural vanilla instead."
34_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"this sounded good. NOT. Foamy and slimy. What ARE you doing to it and who would think this is good? It SHOULD be. But it isnt. I am depending on Blue Bell vanilla bean these days. It tastes like a better version or Breyers old original vanilla bean flavor when it was made with just milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla ~ 40 years ago ... only a little better. I would actually prefer the good old ice milk from the old days... who needs all that fat?!? The fat free Breyers or the 1/2 fat variety you used to make was quite good, and Id load up the freezer with it in the summer, but I cant find it near me any more. Id like a big bowl, and add whatever toppings I wanted-- usually my own grated chocolate for a real choc. chip. Mr. B? I hope this was helpful..."
34_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Why why why did i put this in my mouth? Why did i bring it into my household do I not love my wife and children? This was horrible I don’t think even the neighborhood stoner would eat this. I thought breyers was a stand up company but after this I’m left questioning did they mean to offend my tastebuds? Do you like making small children hate their well earned desert time.
34_breyers,3,3.0,1.0,I tried this flavor today and it was filled with waffle cone and heath pieces. You get more with Breyers. The only complaint I have is that the ice cream had a very odd texture and left a slight aftertaste. Kind of like diet ice cream.
34_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I was very excited to get this as Ive had a new obsession with ice cream with waffle cone pieces! Examples are Ben and Jerrys ""Americone Dream"" and Blue Bells ""Ice Cream Cone"". However, I was pretty disappointed by this flavor as as it is mostly vanilla/chocolate ice cream with very small pieces of toppings mixed in. I would have loved larger pieces that waffle cone cookie depicted mixed in!"
34_breyers,1,3.0,2.0,"I somewhat agree with the first review of the Heath and Waffle cone, but I was even reluctant to give it one star. It might not have been quite so bad if you had kept the toffee flavored ice cream, but then again that might not have helped it much either. The Heath Blasts is very good. This most definitely is not."
34_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I was buying ice cream only for the kids. When I saw the 2/1 heath waffle cone mix. I let them get theirs and I grabbed that one. On the box it shows a swirl and mix of vanilla and chocolate with candy pieces. I was sold and ready for my spoon. I didn’t even wait when I got home I cracked it open and my jaw dropped. My kids asked what’s wrong...”There’s no vanilla in this at all!” Was my reply. I’m not a big chocolate person, but those two flavors on my favorite and it didn’t taste good. It was heavy on the chocolate flavor, which I understand since I got an ice cream with two chocolate flavors. The image showed vanilla which is what really made me feel like a kid in a toy store. The combo of all that. It was sad I didn’t eat it after the first couple spoons. I bought it a week ago and I finally said I would post about it. Not a big posting person. Can it have a little more swirling of flavors. If so I’ll give it a second try thanks"
34_breyers,2,3.0,2.0,"I loved the Heath Frozen Dessert, I couldn’t get enough of it. I am disappointed that it has been changed to Heath with Waffle Cone. I tried it but do not care for it. It just doesn’t the same good flavor. Please bring back the Heath Frozen Dessert. Thank You, Linda"
34_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"The Heath and Waffle Cone 2 in 1 tells you it’s “frozen dairy dessert.” Pay attention. It’s not ice cream. It tastes and, more importantly, feels like a watered-down simulation of ice cream. It has so much air churned into it that it seems to vaporize under your spoon. The flavors are diluted. It seems really no fun."
34_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,This ice cream was not good. It tasted like milky frozen water. The heath and waffle cone were barely included. It cost about the same as a pint of Ben and Jerrys or Hagen Daaz and I will continue to enjoy the consistency of those brands instead of this disappointment.
34_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,This product had no discernible pieces of Heath and the pieces of waffle cone were rubbery and chewy. I was pretty shocked as Breyers almost always delivers on flavor and quality. Wish I could get my money back for this one.
34_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Don’t waste your calories or money! It has NO heath flavor or waffle cone! Was so disappointed. My husband and I always get choc and vanilla for kids. We got this for us as a special treat and we’re SO disappointed.
34_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,My sister and I just ate this ice cream and we both agree that the chocolate pieces taste exactly like nail polish. Not really something I’d ever recommend to anyone. Ever. Seriously don’t eat it.

35_breyers,3,13.0,2.0,"My husband and I eat ice cream every night before bed. He loves the Breyers gelato and I like the butter pecan no sugar added. Although the ice cream is very delicious, the pecans themselves are, more often than not, rancid and dried up. It happens so often that I wonder why such a high quality ice cream company would use dried up, rancid pecans. I sometimes get one that is very bitter and it ruins the taste of the ice cream. I do love the butter pecan but the rancid pecans ruins it!"
35_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"I come from a long line of Breyers family. My grandfather was a refrigeration engineer there back when the average household still had ice boxes, so needless to say we’ve been eating Breyers all my life with Butter Pecan being my mothers and now my favorite. This sugar-free version is a dead ringer for their original. I do not taste any aftertaste from the sweetener, it is rich and buttery and I have not had the problems with the pecans that others have mentioned. The only negative comment is that it’s a little bit fluffy like it has air whipped into it, but I have felt that way about all the Breyers ice cream over the past couple decades, it’s not as thick and heavy as it used to be when I was a kid. I am on keto, I wish they would list net carbs but I’m guessing from the label it is 7 g per serving. Still worth it! Delicious stuff especially over a warmed keto brownie."

36_breyers,1,20.0,1.0,My son has type 1 diabetes and we give him 15 grams of carbs before bed to keep his sugar a little higher overnight. The carb smart fudge bars were great and raised his blood sugar about 100 points. These vanilla bars raised his blood sugar over 400 points! I would like to assume they had a bad batch but just in case I wont be buying anymore of these.
36_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,I have been buying these for years. I’m sure a few years ago they got slightly smaller in size but cost the same. I understood we were in a recession I didn’t mind and I stayed a faithful buyer but now very recently the flavor has changed and they have a slightly bitter after taste that they did not have before.  This completely ruins the treat for me. Tried it twice just to be sure. After almost 10 years I won’t be buying these anymore and they were my favorite :(

I bought a new container last weekend and to my disappointment I discovered it also does not have any candy peices in it at all.  Check out the attached picture.  Zero chocolate and zero taffy.  Ive been buying this flavor for years. This now makes 3 containers in 2 months that have been this way.  All Im getting in the containers is vanilla ice cream with caramel.   Thats now about $18.00 wasted. The product in the container looks nothing like the picture on the lid.  You folks need to fix this or just quit selling it.  Time for me to find another brand!!"

I seriously thought I was being punked. I thought my Mom took out the ""Heath ice cream"" and put in something else. There was NOT ONE PIECE OF CANDY BAR IN ENTIRE CONTAINER ! In addition the consistency was nothing like Id ever seen. Like cool whip out in a blender with custard then only partially frozen. Im sad that I had to throw away $6.00.

As a point of differentiation, please expand your line to meet the consumer demand for healthier options in terms of simple and clean ingredients.

BP used be Natural Vanilla with added pecans and that was all. Now its this strange viscous goo. Ever since Unilever took over theyve been adding all this junk so as to produce the product more cheaply and therefore sell it cheap.

Who was it a kid named Mikey stuttering over another leading brands ingredients? And clearly could read milk,sugar, cream (?) and strawberries on the Breyers label! That said the frozen dessert is misleading when seeing the Breyers label. I noticed that it had the unilever trademark (soap makers) While it was sweet at first taste, the end result will be purchasing a real ice cream product- not this artificial gummy concoction made cheaply."

I had to throw the whole carton away. It was a while before I purchased any more. Thinking the first event was a fluke, I tried the Butter Pecan again.

I can confidently say now that Breyers Buttered Pecan ice cream is a solid third choice if my first two brands arent available. The flavor of the buttered pecan is not very ""buttered"" and is more like vanilla ice cream with pecans. I prefer mine with the buttery taste. The pecans themselves were a bit softer and soggy than hard and crunchy but their flavor was to die for! The texture was interesting in that it starts out a grainy/gritty kind of texture then transforms into a smooth creamy texture in your mouth. While I have other brand choices in this flavor that I prefer, I will be trying different flavors of the Breyers ice cream as their price is in line with the other major brands."

Before trying this product, you should know the butter pecan flavor in this ice cream is not a strong flavor but more of a mild flavor. It really tastes more of a vanilla ice cream than a butter pecan flavor. I was disappointed with this as you want to be able to taste the buttery sweetness that butter pecan flavor usually exuberates. The pecans in the ice cream were packed full of flavor and had a great crunch to them. They tasted of a toasted nut flavor, crunchy and crisp and not soft or soggy even though they are packed into ice cream. The only downfall with the pecans is that there were not enough in the ice cream. In my opinion, there should have been more quantity of pecans in the ice cream. Overall the ice cream itself is creamy and milky and not thin or watery, but lacks that punch of butter pecan flavor and needs to have more nuts in it."

I know its not supposed to be ice cream, but how deceiving it is to someone who doesnt read the smaller labels. This is literally the worst frozen thing I ever put in my mouth, and I am a die hard chocolate and anything peanut butter fan. The product tasted all icy, like as if i took a regular milk, sugar, and flavoring and froze it. Terrible, terrible. Breyers you need to change your game. I highly doubt this is what the people want.

42_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,There was nothing in this ice cream. It’s just plain chocolate. I suppose they aren’t lying when they say 35% more. Since a percentage of zero is a multiplication and zero times anything is always going to be zero.

I am sad that this is hard to find now though and has been replaced with the Vanilla version instead in most stores around me. Dont be deceived by the negative reviews left here. Just read them and see how unrelated to the actual product they are and not an actual review of the product or due to their inability to read etc. An absolute must for chocolate and peanut butter fans."
42_breyers,2,3.0,2.0,I rarely complain about products. I agree with others who have said it has barely any Reese’s or peanut butter. It’s basically just a mild chocolate ice cream. I won’t buy again unless they say “we’ve beefed it up with more Reese’s.”
42_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I picked up the vanilla reeses from Breyers. It was very good considered the price. Im a breyers buyer tho. I eat all the flavors from breyers. But with that said good product for the price.
42_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This has half the calories of any B and J and it’s better than most. Calorie for calorie this is the best ice cream on the planet.
42_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Creamy, dreamy, chocolaty and peanut buttery ... need I say more?!"
43_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,"I have to say, I am disappointed with the new Waffle Cone. Gone are the Blasts, which was chock full of true waffle cone pieces, caramel swirl and chocolate bits. This new version has different waffle cone pieces that are not as tasty as the original and just didnt have as much goodness to it! I am sad to see this recipe change and hope the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup hasnt changed! I was also very disappointed when the Samoas was discontinued. Someone who has Breyer Blasts every single night (and recommended it to anyone!!), is wondering what she will find that is of equal quality and taste."
43_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Please dont discontinued making waffle cone ice cream its my absolute favorite I wont buy anything else. I have it every day after lunch.
43_breyers,5,7.0,0.0,I am in love with this flavor and cant keep it stocked at my house! I wish they would sell gallon buckets!
43_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I read all the reviews and was disappointed in the 1-star reviews. I never had the flavor theyre all mentioning...Blasts...but dont care. I probably wouldnt have liked it because Im more of a supple-flavor person because I LOVE vanilla ice cream the most. THIS Waffle Cone is all I know and I LOVE IT!!! Its softer than I usually like but the flavors are just perfect. In fact, Im going out to buy some more in a few minutes. Sadly, I confess I ate the entire carton in one day by myself!!!"
43_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,"Bryers recently changed recipe is extremely disappointing. The old had tons of caramel, waffle bits and the ice cream was noticablly creamer. This new recipe is bland, not a lot of taste. We use to buy 1 box a week...now no more. Very sad."
43_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,I absolutely just love this icecream!! When we start eating it we just cant stop eating it.
43_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,This is one of the best ice creams from a package Ive had. love it!!
43_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I just bought this at Publix and it tastes totally different from the kind I had a few months ago. The waffle cone is different, not the same flavors and so forth. I cant return it since Ive eaten some of it and its not so horrible that Im going to throw it out, but I will not be buying this again."
44_breyers,5,11.0,1.0,I have no idea what the first reviewwe was talking about this ice cream tastes exactly like the ice cream bars if not better and when you mix it with Breyers chocolate chip ice cream its like heaven.
44_breyers,5,10.0,1.0,This is my all time favorite ice cream. It is the perfect combination of orange sherbet and creamy but light ice cream. It tastes just like the dreamsicles I remember from my childhood.
44_breyers,5,6.0,0.0,This flavor takes me back to my childhood!!! Had it in Florida and need to find it here in Illinois close to home YUM!!
44_breyers,5,9.0,3.0,This is awesome! Creamy vanilla with a great orange flavor sherbet swirl. It has slightly more vanilla which is perfect as the orange flavor is perfectly strong. The vanilla adds exactly the right amount of creaminess! Love it!
44_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,I was disappointed in this flavor of Brewers. It did not taste like the Good Humor Dreamsicle that I was led to believe. Something has an off putting taste. I assume its the orange part. I love sherbet and this fell short.
44_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,I love the orange creamsicle i remember eating the creamsicle popsicle as a child it tastes exactly like it even better exactly its heaven in a bowl at any time thank you Breyers for this delicious treat
44_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Love this flavor! It reminds me of childhood Creamsicles that we would get at the corner store. Btw, you used to have a lemon flavor that was amazing. It would be fun to have that back again!"
44_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,I was excited to try this ice cream. I took about 4 bites. It tastes yucky. I will throw it away. The orange flavor is horrid. It taste like a bad medicine.
44_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Ive had several cartons of the ice cream, first time was perfect, second was horrible. The ice cream and sherbet had melted together leaving at rather unpleasant taste. The next few times were perfect, good mix of orange and ice cream."
44_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,I love orange creamsicles! This ice cream unfortunately didn’t come close to having enough orange flavor for this girl. I won’t purchase this again.

45_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"So I went into Walmart today with the intention of buying the ben&jerry’s chocolate caramel cheesecake truffle ice cream but it’s like 5 bucks for a pint, so I saw this and thought I’d try it since it was twice as much ice cream but half the price. Sooooo regret my choice. I took the first bite, immediately disappointed. But I thought ok, maybe I need to get some of the strawberry swirl in with it... I preceded to dig through the whole carton, NO SWIRL. And I’m not talking like oh there’s some swirl but very little.. no, literally none, not a spec of strawberry. On top of that I think there was 5 total pieces of cheesecake in the whole thing. I googled it to see if anyone else had this happen, didn’t see any other complaints about it but I didn’t look very hard either. I don’t see how I could be the only one with this problem. I took some pictures, the lighting isn’t very good, but I assure you I did not get a drop of strawberry in the dang thing. Bummed... I’ll be expecting a replacement carton at my doorstep by 9am tomorrow morning, and it better be packed with swirl dangit."
45_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,I am guilty of eating half of the container and did not get a sigle peice of cheesecake!
45_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Very disappointed doesn’t taste anything like strawberry cheesecake at all taste more of like a birthday cake of some sort and barely any cheesecake bits waste of money will never purchase breyers again usually never do because of how expensive but wanted to see if this was any good AND ITS NOT ! Smh see barely any strawberry and can’t even see any cheesecake taste horrible
45_breyers,3,5.0,0.0,I loved yr sara lee strawberry cheesecake then u went to ny style which seems to me less strawberry and cheese Its like vanilla ice cream not the same.not as good
45_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,The taste is like pink strawberry ice cream with a weird very weird cheesecake artificial flavored added. Havent seen a single piece of cheesecake or crumb yet. Wish Ive bought the double chocolate truffle instead which I love
45_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I saw this in the store and instantly got excited because for a while they discontinued it. I get home, fixes me a big bowl only to be disappointed! This does not taste good ! I love Strawberry cheesecake but this taste like a bad off brand. I had to do some research because this is not how I remembered this tasting. Can you guys please please bring back the Sara Lee version of Strawberry cheesecake. This was a complete waste of money"
45_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,I love this..I buy it a few times a month lol. Thank you Bryers for such a delicious product.
45_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"Ive always been on breyers fan but this one is a swing and a miss. Strawberry flavor is a little weird but would be tolerable and even good if it actually had any cheesecake in it. Only 2 or 3 pieces in a half a container. When you actually get a bite with some in it its pretty good, but good luck finding any."
46_breyers,1,14.0,2.0,"I used to love Breyer’s rocky road ice cream. Now it’s that fake “frozen dessert” that is not worth eating. Just in the last year or two it has gotten so much worse. The chocolate in the ice cream and covering the almonds tastes cheap. The texture is gross like fake ice creams have. Can hardly find any marshmallow and those chocolate covered almonds? If it didn’t say they were almonds you’d never know. If you are hungry for the good rocky road ice cream you remember, you won’t find it here! Back to Haagen Daz for me. The extra cost is worth it - I’ll just wait for a sale and buy less of it. Win/win!"
46_breyers,1,14.0,0.0,"This flavor used to be one of my go tos for Breyers, but this flavor tastes strange now. Something has been changed. It looks like chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirl, but I didnt taste any chocolate, only marshmallow. And even the marshmallow tastes weird. Im completely dissatisfied with rocky road. Bring back the former recipe!"
46_breyers,2,13.0,0.0,"We are a family of six, with three teenage sons. Breyers has been a staple in our freezer for year. The last carton of Rocky Road we bought was very different. We all noticed it! To me, the nuts had a strange taste - almost like rancid peanuts! Quality is going down hill. Youre losing faithful customers."
46_breyers,1,10.0,1.0,"I do not usually buy Breyers. I thought I would give it a try. Rocky Road has been a favorite flavor, but I was very disappointed. The texture was off. It was not rich and creamy. Tasted like ice cream that had thawed and been refrozen. Where is the gooey marshmallow? Pretty much on existent. The chocolate covered almonds were like balls of fake chocolate. Terrible product! Going back to Blue Bunny!!!"
46_breyers,1,12.0,2.0,my wife and i both thought that this last batch had a unique flavor that wasnt great.
46_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,This WAS my favorite ice cream. I dont know what you guys did but it taste weird now. Just go back to making good tasting chocolate ice cream instead of messing around in the food lab.
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK, WORST ICE CREAM EVER, WAIT ITS NOT ICE CREAN ITS NOW FROZEN DAIRY DESERT. GOING BACK TO BLUE BUNNY OR PUBLIX BETTER ICE CREAM ITS REAL ICE CREAM, NOT WHAT SOME COMPANY THINKS WE MUST HAVE, KINDA LIKE NY AND THEIR SODA TAX. WILL RETURNING THIS JUNK BACK WALMART...……."
46_breyers,1,15.0,12.0,Worst ice cream I’ve ever frickin’ had. It tastes like black licorice... Why would you do this to us??? Not worth the calories or money which is something I wouldn’t normally say about ice cream. Refund please
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"What happened to Rocky Road? This used to be my favorite. I was craving the crunchy nuts and marshmallows, but got some kind of weird chocolate covered nuts that were waxy and not crunchy at all. I actually picked them all out, yuck. Why change something that was so delicious?"
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I LOVE rocky road ice cream, but this one is the worst! The texture is off as it has melted marshmallows in it opposed to regular marshmallow squares and the chocolate covered almonds taste like black licquorice. Definitely wont be buying the flavored brand again."
46_breyers,4,10.0,6.0,This is a great ice cream it tastes amazing! But the only thing it needs is more marshmallow:)
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"This used to be my favorite ice cream, but this last carton I bought is completely different. It’s not creamy, hardly any marshmallow and there’s a coating on the nuts that has a weird, gross texture. I’m switching to a different brand."
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I completely dislike the coating over the nut bits in this ice cream. Gross stuff. Doesn’t taste almonds to me at all and just leaves a terrible aftertaste in the mouth. Rocky road used to be good but not from this brand.
46_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"My husband and I bought Rocky road ice cream and were very disappointed in the quality. It wasnt as tasty. Didnt have a good chocolate flavor, and just seemed bland. So disappointed in the Rocky road ice cream"
46_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,So gross!!! Will never spend my money on your product again!! Yuck!
46_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I’m very disappointed in this rocky road Ice cream. Rocky road has always been my favorite. But this taste so extra sweet like it has so much added sugar. The chocolate covered almonds is just over board and the chocolate on the taste cheap. And the gooey marshmallow cream is just yuck! I’ve never been more disappointed in ice cream than I am now.
46_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"This is one of the worst ice cream flavors I’ve ever tried. Please sample your competitors’ rocky road and actually put almonds in it. And better chocolate. I agree with another person who said the chocolate-covered nuts taste like black licorice. And I really don’t like black licorice. This needs to be revamped, Breyers!"
46_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"I was in a hurry when I bought this, and didnt discover until later it contained carrageenan, an ingredient I try to avoid. My disappointment increased upon sampling it because this ""frozen dessert"" is lacking any actual marshmallows or natural almonds, which in my opinion is what makes rocky road a great flavor."
46_breyers,2,2.0,1.0,"I bought a carton of Rocky Road today and was so excited to eat it tonight. Whoa! What happened? The ice cream did not taste chocolatey, there were barely any marshmallows and why was the nut covered in some type of chocolate flavoring. So disappointed in my Breyers! ☹️"
46_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,So I was expecting the chocolate ice cream or frozen dairy dessert base to be just as delicious as the plain chocolate flavor and it wasnt at all. It was subpar and almost ruined the ice cream if not for the delicious chocolate covered almonds.
47_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Bought home the “cherry” vanilla tub hoping it would look like the picture on the box. I scooped out about 3/4 of the box and examined each scoop carefully for signs of a cherry. I couldn’t even find a piece of cherry skin, not even a pit, stem, or hint of natural cherry coloring left behind. It’s like opening a box of lucky charms only to find the kids ate all the marshmallows. Dang kids always stealing me lucky charms. It’s like Luke finding out Vader was his father. Noooooooo!!! Ben..uh Breyers...why didn’t you tell me??"
47_breyers,4,3.0,1.0,"Fantastic cherry vanilla ice cream really honestly it’s really delicious but I have to say you simply cannot put in such delicious cherries in such an amazing vanilla ice cream and put so few cherries! I mean I love buying this, and I always buy it, every spring & all summer but I’m always left with an enormous amount of vanilla ice cream that I have to get rid of because I don’t like eating a lot of ice cream. But those cherries are amazing and you guys would sell a lot more of this ice cream if you would double or even triple the amount of halved cherries you put in. In the meantime I will keep buying it and I will keep fishing my cherries out. Lol!"
47_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,"Where do I start? I could go into detail, but, I guess to summarize it best, I will simply say that this cannot be categorized as food.....let alone as ice cream. I assume Breyers knows this—thus the name change to “frozen dairy dessert” (whatever this means). The Cherry Vanilla tastes like it was produced in a laboratory......straight out of a beaker. Such a shame. Breyers used to have great ice cream. I used to love the Cherry Vanilla flavor. Cherry Vanilla is not even a shadow of its former self. I took several bites and threw the contents of the bowl and the remainder of the half gallon down the disposal. Congratulations Breyers. Your Cherry Vanilla is now to ice cream what Velveeta is to cheese."
47_breyers,1,22.0,3.0,"Ive eaten Breyers since I was a kid in Pittsburgh 40 years ago. Just bought a carton of Cherry Vanilla Frozen Dairy Dessert today - my first in several years. The product was soft and I thought it had been thawed. After keeping in freezer at minus ten for several hours it never firmed. The texture is also really off. It doesnt feel right on your tongue, its too soft, and just isnt ice cream. Ill not buy it again."
47_breyers,1,14.0,1.0,I have been buying Breyers Cherry Vanilla for years but stopped for a while and have just recently bought it again. The recipe is totally different than what it used to be. On first taste I got this weird medicated taste. Its actually horrible. Go back to the old recipe! I would not recommend this flavor and will not be buying this again.
47_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,Being a loyal buyer of your Ice cream Cherry Vanilla and six other flavors on a regular basis. I am disssppointed with the lack of cherries in the last 2 half gallons I purchased. It is hard enough to find down here in the south but when found to find it lacking is very upsetting. Im sorry I will still not buy any other brand but I may have to give up in the cherry vanilla. I lived in Philly for 35 yrs and would never find a better brand than Breyers!
47_breyers,4,8.0,1.0,"This is my new obsession! I love it and so does my son, but where are the cherries? I counted 3 cherry halves in this last one we just shined off. I bought some frozen cherries to add in but those were awful compared to the juicy breyers ones. Love it, ADD MORE CHERRIES PLEASEEEEEE!!!!!"
47_breyers,2,4.0,0.0,"I vividly remember this being my dads next favorite ice cream behind breyers chocolate back when I was growing up in the 70s. I liked it too and remember how much I liked how cool and tastey it felt going down in the hot summers. I remember it being actually Frozen and when it melted it being a liquid unlike that frothy other brand me and my sisters despised called sealtest. I bought a container of this two days ago and just opened it and was surprised to see that it was soft, not really frozen. Tasting it left a faint taste of cough syrup, but nothing unbearable. The biggest disappoinment was the foamy consistency as it melted and the ultimate let down was the complete lack of a satisfactory experience on my pallet once it was gone. It just didnt have that consistent cold experience that real ice cream gives when eaten. It honestly reminded me immediately of that other brand that I was so disappointed to see appear in the grocery bags when I was a kid. What happened?"
47_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,Used to be a wonderful and dependable brand....no more. Same awful ingredients as anyone else......also airy weird taste now.
47_breyers,2,4.0,0.0,Use to love but the taste and texture is no longer good. This no longer tastes like ice cream at all
47_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I grew up eating Breyers. I loved it because it was natural and delicious. Now I keep trying flavors and they go uneaten in my freezer. I thought Id go back to my childhood standby, Cherry Vanilla. It didnt taste like ice cream at all. In fact, it had no flavor except for the unnaturally sweet cherries. Im so disappointed Breyers stopped using natural ingredients and turned all my favorites ice creams into ""frozen treats""."
47_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,"This is not a high quality, natural tasting, delictable product. I was tricked as others were into thinking this was all natural ice cream. Besides the noticeable gummy texture, the texture is all wrong. I never toss ice cream out because I am an ice cream lover, but I can’t get through the container. Take a moment and read the labels. I won’t make this mistake again. I’m going back to mint chocolate chip and butter pecan. I hope there hasn’t been changes in their formulations."
47_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I have been a Breyers fan since childhood, and Im not sure what a ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" actually means, but it certainly isnt like Breyers Ice Cream.

47_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,First the entire container had maybe 10 cherries total so that was just disappointing. Second the vanilla tasted very odd. I will get this flavor ever again. I don’t know what they changed but it tastes very artificial.
47_breyers,1,4.0,2.0,"I fell for this again , second time. This is not ice cream , its a frozen dairy dessert. It will never harden like ice cream does. The texture is weird and the taste is off. I cant believe I didnt read the carton before purchase. Never again !!"
47_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"Breyers Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream used to be my favorite ice cream of all time. Perfect blend of vanilla ice cream, actual vanilla bean and cherries. Now it is some weird frozen goo. Horrible. I will never buy a Breyers product again."
47_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,If you read the carton you will realize that this is not ice cream. Different texture and where are the cherries. I grew up in Philly and we always had Breyers and the quality was superb. No longer.
47_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"Full of additives, and you have the nerve to boast about no hormones on the label. Bring back the old cherry vanilla, a wonderful, natural product."
47_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,"I was searching online to see if it was just me.. then I see someone saying it tasted ""medicated"". I threw out what I had in my bowl thinking I was tasting toothpaste from an hour earlier... but no... brushed with just water after dinner and tried again. Tastes like mint. Pretty nasty."
47_breyers,1,3.0,2.0,I have been eating this ice cream for years but I have not eaten in while.I asked my wife to gets me some. Well it does not task the same. It is too sweet for me. It is not the same anymore. maybe you should make sugar free now.
47_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,Please dont fix products that are already perfect. The simple ingredients made this delicious! Now it is a dairy dessert??? What is a dairly dessert? I thought Breyers made premium ice cream! P.S. Check out the comments online re: Breyers Cherry Vanilla Dairy Dessert!
47_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,Love the taste of this flavor. This is definitely one of my favorites! Love the size of cherries that are packed in the ice cream.

48_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,This ice cream is delicious. Yummy for my tummy. I love this with Oreo cookies and great ice cream together. This is a great combination dessert.
48_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,My absolute favorite that Breyers makes!!! Love it!!
49_breyers,1,12.0,0.0,We basically got only chocolate chip and absolutely no cooke dough. We really thought maybe the cookie dough just settled but there was definitely no chewy cookie dough chunks as advertised.
49_breyers,2,7.0,0.0,"Something is wrong with the cookie dough; its no longer chewy and rich like before. Now it simply crumbles/disintegrates when you chew it and it tastes like a graham cracker - YUCK. I may give it another try before entirely ruling this brand/flavor out; this has been my favorite cookie dough ice cream for many years, so it may be worth giving it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, just maybe, I got an off batch... (However, more likely than not, a beloved brands recipe is being manipulated by the bottom line and the quality is simply taking a nosedive. Oh, well. What do you expect in a consumerist culture, right?)"
49_breyers,1,4.0,1.0,I bought a half gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough as a weekly dessert and have to say i was so disappointed with the flavor that I didn’t eat it. Something seemed wrong with it as it smelled like spoiled milk and didn’t taste any better. I came straight home fro. The grocery store and it did not melt in any way. When I opened it that evening after dinner for some it didn’t seem right. Driving ll the way back to the store didn’t seem worth it. I have all of the information from the package if you want the details. This is the very first time I have ever been disappointed in your ice cream so I thought I would let you know.
49_breyers,1,6.0,0.0,"Breyers used to have the best stuff, and the cookie dough was always a solid choice. But, we just bought it last night (after not having any for a few months) and... it tastes really bad. Theres this strong aftertaste that reminds me of sweet and low (kind of that... hyper sweet, metallic sort of flavor). It does not appear to contain anything like that, which is perhaps even more troubling because ... why does it taste like that, then? It really shouldnt taste like that at all. It was really unpleasant. It wasnt expired, or even close to expiring. Threw the rest of it away. Ew."
49_breyers,1,6.0,0.0,Im not sure where to begin. The aftertaste of this ice cream leaves a bitter taste in my mouth unlike any other ice cream product Ive had before. The cookie was plentiful but honestly was the only good part of this product. I rather have collected all the cookie dough and ate it that way so that I could avoid the ice cream part. Ive enjoyed other Breyer products and cannot understand why this one is different. Could it be that this ice cream product is not actually ice cream but Frozen Dairy Desert? Disappointing.
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"First of all, ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" is a terrible excuse for ice cream, and I already know this, but I was tired and not thinking clearly when I went grocery shopping. I thought I was putting actual ice cream in my cart. Imagine my disappointment when one evening after work I was looking forward to mowing down on some ice cream and I open my freezer to this atrocity. Secondly, where are the cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips? If you consider every handful of bites enough to be satisfactory, youre sorely mistaken. Thirdly, has anyone at Breyers actually tasted this nonsense? If so, they should be reassigned to another position. Breyers, read your reviews. This is not a product that people enjoy eating."
49_breyers,1,5.0,2.0,I purchased breyers chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and its safe to say I will NEVER be purchasing it again . There is not one single chocolate chip or a hint of cookie dough anywhere in the ice cream . How does this even make it off the production line ? .
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,The name Breyers is a well known and respected name. I have been buying Breyers for years and have never had this issue before this. I was very disappointed in the lack of cookie dough drops in the ice cream. It was chocolate chip ice cream.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Im a lover of cookie dough ice cream. Many people are, as well. When I saw that my local grocery store had this ice cream on sale, I thought I try it. While the ice cream was fresh, there wasnt much flavor and wasnt as rich as other brands that Ive tried. What made me most disappointed was the cookie dough was not soft, chewy and rich like youd expect. the cookie dough pieces were crunch and gritty (almost like a graham cracker like another reviewer mentioned). I will have to go back to the other brand that Ive been eating until Breyers develops a new recipe."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Breyers- what happened to this ice cream? It is terrible! I grew up eating Breyers strawberry and vanilla. This evening we opened a gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor and it tasted like it was made with spoiled milk. I immediately assumed the recipe changed to make it “healthier” and went to google for answers. My question is still not answered but I was sad to see this flavor even has horrible reviews all over your very own website!! Hello! It’s time to change the recipe! Please don’t send me a coupon, I don’t want it, I just want the Breyers I know and love from my childhood back!"
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I remember eating Bryers when I was younger and the flavor was so bold, the texture was perfect, and the after taste consisted of vanilla. This particular flavor had chocolate chips rather then waxy bits and cookie dough was softer and more flavorful. Fast forward to today I grabbed this product for my kids to have an ice cream night and it was everything BUT a treat. My 4yr old that I call the foodie tasted it and said he didnt want it. My 11 year old saud "" what made you get this"". I ate a spoon and threw the rest away. Kids turned down ice cream this ice cream... Thats a problem."
49_breyers,5,3.0,2.0,Obviously there was a mix-up a few months ago and there wasnt a lot of cookie dough in everyones ice cream hence all of the bad reviews within the same time period. Whatever was wrong was corrected because my ice cream was perfect! I usually buy whatever ice cream is on sale and last month Breyers was on sale so we got the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. My family loved it and ate it within 2 days. This month we got Edys Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and it was not even close to being as good! I will buying Breyers exclusively from now on whether on sale or not!
49_breyers,2,4.0,0.0,"I thought this product was going to be regular ice cream since it isnt one of the ""Blasts."" I was wrong. After I took the first bite, it was obvious to me that it wasnt regular ice cream and tasted horrible compared to even the store brand cookie dough ice cream. It seemed too sweet and not very creamy. I didnt notice it said ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" until after I ate it. Never again."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Purchased Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream. Immediately upon scooping I thought i had purchased Vanilla Bean. This product failed miserably with barely any dough, chips and flavor."
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"I was expecting this ice cream to have loads of cookie dough, because I have purchased other flavors and they were very good. The picture indicates lots of cookie dough which is very misleading because this ice cream has hardly 10 pieces of cookie dough in the whole container. I literally searched the whole box of ice cream with a spoon and found little to no pieces of cookie dough inside of it . Please if your reading this Breyers add more cookie dough."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I just bought one of these and it didnt have ANY cookie dough in it....awkward. Pretty sure that it was a mistake. Still mega disappointing. :/
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,4 pieces of cookie dough.... very dissatisfied with ANOTHER unilever
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"This cookie dough has some weird taste like they switched to artificial ingredients or just a plain inferior sweetener. I bought this a couple of months ago and I meant to keep a mental note not to make the mistake of getting this flavor again in your brand, but earlier this week I forgot and made the purchase anyway as opposed to another flavor. I am highly disappointed....again."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Breyers Cookie Dough ice cream was the only option at the store. They were sold out of the generic brand that I normally buy. So I decided to go ahead and spend the extra few dollars and try a name brand. I was very disappointed. The ice cream tasted strange, like whiskey, and it had a foamy texture. My first thought was to check the expiration date. It wasnt expired and I hadnt left it out of the freezer. I only live a few minutes from the store I purchased it from. I would not buy this again and do not recommend it to others."
49_breyers,1,4.0,0.0,The cookie dough tasted like it had spoiled. I bought another carton thinking something was wrong with the first one but it had the same sour taste. Yuck
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,I purchased the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream. Tasted sour and leaves a bitter after taste. I originally thought the product might have gone bad but after reading other reviews I realized that it is a problem with the ice cream itself. Could not finish the bowl and will be throwing away the tub. Absolutely discussing!
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"Had a scoop (of my favorite ice cream) after my fiancé purchased a tub after a bad day, one bite in we were both sure that it had gone bad and pitched it. We bought a second tub later and it was just as sour tasting with a weird aftertaste, popped in back in the freezer to see if there had been a contamination recall for a batch. A quick look shows that the formula changed and everyone else noticed just as much as we did."
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"My ice cream has very little cookie dough and has a strange after taste to it. Both my husband and I think it might taste like cherries or some artificial sweet fruity taste. Either way, gross!"
49_breyers,2,3.0,0.0,Purchased tonight and brought home. Tasted strange at first. Then I realized that the “vanilla” ice cream tastes of strawberry. I’m wondering if there was a glitch in the manufacturing process.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I have always liked Breyers ice cream, but this carton was HORRIBLE. I thought my taste buds were off the first scoop, but the second time I tried it with my husband and it was just as bad. The vanilla tasted fruity and the cookie dough ""pellets"" were inedible. Im throwing the carton away. I really hope the recipe changes back to what it was when the cookie dough was edible."
49_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,The downside of cookie dough ice cream is always there not being enough cookie dough. But breyers really loads this ice cream with cookie dough and it tastes great ❤️
49_breyers,1,3.0,0.0,"The only flavor was the cookie dough chunks! The ice cream had absolutely no flavor! For the price we paid, I am more than disappointed!!"
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,As an ice cream addict and a big Breyers fan I bought the cookie dough ice cream as soon as I saw it on shelf. I was immensely disappointed. The cookie dough tastes awful — like a metallic flavour and it lingers for a while ruining the ice cream so much more. I’m not sure what to do with the rest of the tub but definitely am not eating it
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I always buy cookie dough icecream and decided to give breyers cookie dough icecream a try for the first time. The icecream almost tastes and smells like spoiled milk. And the cookie dough also tastes off with a very unsettling texture. After reading all of the other reviews, I know Im not alone. Wont be buying this again."
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Cant put my fiunger on it but it just tastes strange. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Only ate a few spoonfuls and I am totally turned off. Gonna throw the rest away. The texture was also weird. Not thick and creamy. Best way I can describe it is almost spongy and foamy.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,We bought this and it was just so bad. We couldnt place the weird aftertaste that just overpowers everything. It tastes so chemically and is super unpleasant to eat. Expiration date is so far away too and it was brand new. Throwing it away and never getting again.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"As with other reviewers, the taste was just off. It almost tasted like it was spoiled and I couldnt take more than a few bites. I wasnt about to go return it to the store so it was thrown out. It was not out dated or even close to that. Im very disappointed."
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"So Ive always bought ""Breyers"" brand for every ice cream flavor and have always fell in love. Cookie dough and chocolate chip is the exemption, the taste was disgusting, I was so disappointed. Its the only flavor from this brand I would not recommend."
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"This ice cream has an off, unpleasant taste.  We threw it all away.  Actually, I was looking to see if the ice cream was recalled and came upon this product website.   I was relieved to see it wasn’t recalled but am very disappointed with the product.  "
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This used to be one of our favorites. Bought some last week at Walmart and it tasted horrible. Thought maybe we just got a bad batch. Bought some today at public and it was also awful. Has the recipe changed? I will not be purchasing again.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Horrible flavor. I thought it tasted like sour milk. I checked the expiration date on the carton and online to make sure there wasn’t a recall because it was so TERRIBLE! I immediately threw it out. Never again!
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"We used to purchase Breyers chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream often. However, the past 3 times we have bought it the cookie dough has been terrible. Something has changed. Unfortunately, not for the better!"

49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"This is by far the worst flavor of ice cream I have seen. The cookie dough is the worst part. It tastes bitter, like something is wrong with it. I will not be buying this flavor again."
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,The worst ice cream I’ve eaten. It had a after taste and would melt very quickly. There was NO dough! I would not give this to a family member!!!
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I was very disappointed with your cookie dough ice cream . There was less then ten cookie doughs . I basically paid for chocolate chip icecream
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This was so bad. It doesn’t taste like vanilla at all but has more of a berry taste. Extremely disappointed and won’t be buying again.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,the cookie dough tasted artificial and bitter. it had an awful taste that i tried not to get it in my spoon when eating the ice cream.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This is the only one of Breyers flavors that has a off putting after taste. Makes the whole experience unpleasant.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,Breyers needs to do a full investigation as to why this flavor tastes so weird. I am not buying Breyers again.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I have tried this ice cream twice and both times it tasted like soap. Something about the flavor was way off.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I love ice cream and Breyers is one of my favorite brands - except this flavor. It isn’t good at all.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I love Breyers ice cream but this is the worst ice cream I have ever had. Tastes like green olives!!!
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I bought this and literally got through half the tube and only saw one piece of cookie dough.
49_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,I am not sure why but our carton of cookie dough ice cream tasted like blueberry flavoring
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Usually Breyers is my favorite. But not any more! I recently bought Breyers cookie dough ice cream and the cookie dough was awful. Was like the dough had been freezer burnt and old and then added to the ice cream. It was not enjoyable at all. I threw the whole carton away. The cookie dough looked white like tablets. I’m going to explore different brands!
49_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,Purchased some cookie dough today at Meijer for the kids. They said it tasted strange - I gave it a try and it is definitely not vanilla flavored. It tastes fruity - strawberry perhaps? Cant taste vanilla or cookie dough at all. We buy this occasionally and it has never tasted like this before. Im wondering if we got a wonky batch.
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I cant believe how bad this tastes. I tried it last night, and both my wife and i couldnt get past the first few bites. I tried it again tonight to see if it was something I was eating, and it still tastes horrible. I just dont understand how its even possible for it to tastes so bad."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"This product had a very strange taste that I cannot describe. I had been looking forward to it, and I am wondering if something was wrong with it or if it is just not good. There are plenty of other good choices for chicolate chip cookie dough ice cream or “frozen dessert”"
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I grew up eating Breyers and cookie dough was one of my favorite flavors. I bought some for the first time in years and oh my god, it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like it was made with spoiled milk and it had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of bananas. So disappointing."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"After staying away from Breyers for a decade, I decided to give them a try. What a mistake!!! Little did I know that things that are NOT ice cream hide out in the ice cream section of the freezer at the grocery store. I thought that this stuff was disgusting."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Ice cream taste like sour milk. Yet the best by date is in a year and three months! It taste pretty bad (to what ice cream is suppose to taste like) but I am mostly worried that it might actually be spoiled milk. Who knows.
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Ive never had an issue with Breyers before but my most recent purchase had hardly ANY cookie dough in it. You might as well call this chocolate chip. Why am I paying $4-$5 for a product that cuts corners?
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I was highly disappointed in the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice cream. It was almost like snow cream and did not have a ice-cream smoothness. The taste wasnt good at all and not up to Breyers quality.
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,everyone says it taste sour but I wouldn’t say that. I just had a weird taste. I prefer publix brand of this flavor. All the other ice cream flavors for breyers are good except for this one.
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Tasted like cream. No sugar?!? I eat ice cream a lot! I would never turn down a bowl. Tonight I just couldn’t eat this fake tasting frozen cream. Yuk! Chocolate chip cookie dough.
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Presented in a container made to look like ice cream, but it turns out to be a frozen dairy dessert. Tastes, fake, like chemicals, too sweet, too slimy. Avoid at all costs."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,This cookie dough tastes nothing like the Mrs Fields you used to sell.... this one has no chunks in it and the ice cream is gritty.... disappointing
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"This is the first time, in 44 years, Ive had spoiled ice cream. It was a great experience although I will never buy this great ice cream again."
49_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Got a full bowl that only had one piece of cookie dough that tasted like bleach. Disgusting. Not worth the $4 I paid For it.
50_breyers,5,20.0,0.0,"I got the news that I had to cut dairy from my diet earlier this year due to health reasons, and my search for a good non dairy ice cream subsequently started. Breyers Oreo Non Dairy Ice Cream is the winner by far! As I am also allergic to Soy, this ice cream is perfect for me as it contains neither. Im also a big fan of Oreo. Unlike a lot of other milk-free products, this ice cream tastes real and differs very little in flavor from regular ice cream! I will add, though, that my favorite ice cream before going dairy free was mint chocolate chip. Breyers, if you released a mint chocolate chip flavor of this ice cream, I would be forever grateful."
50_breyers,5,16.0,0.0,"Thank you Breyers for making non-dairy ice cream. Breyers has been my favorite brand of ice cream for years until I developed a dairy allergy, which didnt allow me to eat any ice cream. As of recent I am able to find non-dairy ice cream but the size are awful and pricey. Now I have options thanks to Breyers. My hope is that you will continue to make MORE flavors. I am not a cookies & cream kinda eater but this one is really good, its soft and the taste is typical Breyers. THANKS A BUNCH!! The price is I paid was decent, its backed by the best ice cream brand, so I dont mind paying $6 for Breyers ice cream and its over a pint."
50_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"This is an amazing ice cream! Most non-dairy ice creams dont have the same texture as dairy ice cream, but texture of this almond milk ice cream is perfect. The flavors as well balanced and the almond milk isnt overpowering the flavors of other ingredients. I would highly reccomend this ice cream to both dairy and non-dairy eating friends :D I hope to see more flavors of almond milk ice cream in the future!"
50_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! I love this product, super delicious and at a fraction of the cost compared to other vegan ice creams. I also like that theres coconut oil and ground almonds in the ingredient list. Cant wait for more new flavours!"
50_breyers,5,11.0,0.0,"Breyers Non-Dairy Oreo Cookies and Cream was absolutely amazing! I am lactose intolerant and also vegan so I feel as though I am an expert on non-dairy products. Most non-dairy ice creams taste strange or are just not worth eating. Breyers non-dairy Oreo was the best I have ever tasted. It tastes just like real ice cream, is creamy, and delicious. This is now my go to ice cream. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to cut back on dairy but also it is great for anyone at all! My kids love it and they are very tough critics and eat dairy ice cream. Will be buying again!"
50_breyers,5,33.0,0.0,"This is a great vegan ice cream, and a great price! Thrilled to see Breyers offering vegan ice creams. Hopefully theyll come out with a chocolate vegan ice cream soon!"

50_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I was surprised how delicious Breyers non-dairy Oreo cookies and cream almond milk frozen dessert tastes. You cant tell the difference between almond milk and cow milk in this dessert and its healthier for myself and the environment. My children had a bowl each and when they finished I asked them how was it? They both loved it and said they couldnt taste the difference, I regularly buy Breyers Oreo ice cream, favorite in our house. It would be great if there were more flavors to choose from, I will definitely buy Breyers non-dairy Oreo cookies and cream again. Looking forward to trying the vanilla peanut butter. What a great new product that Breyers has introduced to their customers."
50_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"I had to go to three stores to find the Breyers Non-Dairy Oreo Cookies & Cream ice cream to try, but once I found it, I was happy that I did. it had a slightly different texture than regular ice cream and I hint of almond taste from the almond milk, but it was a great alternative to regular ice cream and didnt make me feel super full and sick after eating it like happens with regular ice cream. We have a friend whos child has a dairy allergy and will definitely pick this up to have as an alternative option when she comes for a birthday party!"
50_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,Love Oreo cookies and Love ice cream but I can’t do the dairy. I was super excited when I discovered this in the store. Totally hit the spot!! Can’t wait for some more non dairy options. Yum!
50_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Wow, the Breyers non dairy ice cream was such a pleasant surprise!! I usually shy away from non dairy ice cream because I just dont think it will compare to the real stuff and that Ill inevitably be disappointed but this product really proved me wrong! I LOVE ice cream but unfortunately dairy doesnt always love me back quite as much and I think this might just be the solution to my dilemma! The ice cream tasted great, had a good creamy consistency and really tastes just like normal dairy ice cream but without any dairy side effects. The only difference I could decider was that it tasted a little lighter than some of the really rich dairy ice creams, but that wasnt really a negative. I think Ive found my new go to treat!"
50_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,I absolutely loved Breyers non-dairy cookies n cream ice-cream as well as the rest of the family. My children could not even tell its non-dairy and trust me they know non-dairy and Gluten food all too well. Love that they use real almond milk and really think they should start putting out more non-dairy flavors. What a great delicious treat for anyone! Wether you are just exploring other healthier food options or can not have dairy products Breyers non dairy is the perfect option!
50_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"I have a dairy allergy, so I was excited to see a new option at Target! The cookies and cream ice cream is delicious and just like I remembered. It was $4.19 at my store, which is cheaper than what a pint of the other dairy free brands costs. And this is twice the size! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope you make more flavors! Would love to see cookie dough and mint chocolate chip someday!"
50_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,Its better than a lot of the non-dairy aternatives out there and a much better value! Good job Breyers!
50_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I have been missing ice cream for a few years now, and was super excited to find this made with almond milk. It tastes amazing I love cookies and cream and its so good, thank you for making a delicious ice cream like always and now I can it without any issues. Hope more flavors come out soon maybe mint and chip and cookie dough ;)..... will definitely be buying more of the cookies n cream with almond milk"
50_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"As a vegan, I have tried numerous flavors of non-dairy ice creams (in almond milk, cashew, coconut) and have not found any I love (without making it from scratch at home with bananas) until now. Thank you Brewers for making a ""normal"" tasting non-dairy ice cream! Cant wait to try the PB vanilla next. If you come up with a delicious non-dairy cotton candy flavor I will be your number one fan! :)"
50_breyers,5,5.0,1.0,"We love this ice cream. Its the only non-pint-sized non-dairy ice cream weve seen and its really tasty. Cant wait till other flavors are available. Or even better, you start making it with coconut milk."
50_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,"I find this ice cream hits the cold and creamy spot, but that is all it does. There are enough cookies, but it is very lacking in flavor! Not real sweet, but I dont taste any of the chocolate that I associate with Oreos, nor do I taste anything really at all but a mild sweetness. Not sure what it needs, but it definitely needs something to boost it and give it some flavor!"
50_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Im not a big fan of cookies n cream ice cream but this is seriously the best dairy free ice cream Ive ever had. And Ive tried countless options! Would LOVE more flavors! Coffee inparticular. You really got this right breyers! I will be buying more.
50_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"Finally someone figured out how to make a non-dairy ""ice cream"" that actually tastes good! I am dairy-free not by choice but because I am not able to tolerate any cows milk products without severe discomfort. I have tried soy, coconut, almond, and rice milk products and found them lacking in taste, texture, or both. I had resigned myself to italian ices and sorbets then my mother found an article in the paper that mentioned Breyers Non-Dairy Cookies and Cream. I ran out to try it and am SO glad that I did! The texture is creamy and the almond taste is not overpowering like in other products I have tried. With the Oreos, there is a nice crunch here and there as well. I wanted a strong chocolate flavor so I added a bit of syrup but this product can stand on its own. Thank you Breyers for making this!! I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to be dairy free."
50_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"I was already a fan of Breyers (though lactose-intolerant, sadly), so I was happy to see this non-dairy version available to try. I enjoyed the texture, still creamy despite being made with almond milk. The Oreo pieces are awesome, but I did find that the amount of sugar was a bit much - it kind of overpowered the taste of vanilla in the ice cream itself. Still, Id gladly try the other flavors available."
50_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"I am lactose intolerant, so I love almond milk in a lot of frozen desserts. I was excited when I saw this! Unfortunately, the taste was mediocre, and it left a greasy feeling on my lips and tongue. The ONLY redeeming factor was the Oreo pieces. I dug them out and left the “ice cream”. I will NOT be purchasing this item again."
50_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This is one of the best non-dairy ice cream products out there when you consider taste and price point. All Breyers needs to do is make more flavors! Now!
51_breyers,1,52.0,5.0,"Breyers coffee ice cream and Breyers in general has been one of my favorites for many, many years so I was extremely disappointed when I tasted this new version. What happened to using only simple, all natural ingredients like milk, cream and sugar? Now it contains things like mono and diglycerides, vegetable gums, and polysorbate 80. I noticed a different mouth feel right away. Oily and disgusting. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this brand any longer. Sad."
51_breyers,1,41.0,5.0,"Growing up, I used to love your coffee ice cream. It has consistently been one of my favorite flavors. But the carton I just bought is going straight in the trash. This new recipe isn’t bolder; it’s bitter! I can’t begin to tell you how disappointed I am. It’s like a childhood friend has passed away. I won’t be buying your ice cream again until I see the old recipe returned. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"
51_breyers,1,20.0,4.0,"Growing up, Breyer’s was the only brand of ice cream family ate. Coffee was a favorite for both myself and my mother. I decided to track down a carton yesterday, I opened it and on the first taste I was absolutely disgusted, it tasted like chemicals. I had to check to see if I’d purchased the wrong brand... no. Then I checked the ingredients and of course, no longer the traditional recipe is used. Corn syrup is the second ingredient! Xanthan gum?!? When I was growing up Breyer’s prided itself on natural, simple ingredients (I remember the commercial from the 90s stating only natural ingredients you can pronounce). I threw the carton in the trash and went for Haagen Daz, which satisfied my craving. I will never purchase Breyer’s again. In the age of organic and natural Breyer’s is a major fail."
51_breyers,1,30.0,3.0,Bring back Coffee Ice Cream. This Frozen dairy dessert is not fit for my dog. I loved your coffee ice cream. it was perfect but I cant stand this poor replacement. Yuck.
51_breyers,1,25.0,5.0,"This is by far the worst tasting coffee flavored ice cream Ive ever had. I love dark roast coffee and drink primarily Colombian roast daily. I expected a coffee taste but also expected it to be sweet after all it is ice cream. But this ""ice cream"" I leaves a burnt coffee after taste in my mouth. Why did you make this coffee ice cream so incredibly bitter? This is not ice cream."
51_breyers,5,2.0,1.0,"This ice cream is delicious for people who love cream/milk with their coffee. More importantly for me, a website on migraine headaches recommended eating a scoop of coffee ice cream every night before going to bed to reduce morning migraines - and oddly enough, it has been helping me! Breyers is the only ""pure"" ice cream I could find without other additives, specifically without carrageenan , which is a known migraine contributor. Unfortunately my local supermarkets are not carrying it now so I must start looking for some other brand, which I already know will be difficult."
51_breyers,5,16.0,6.0,This is my grandmothers favorite brand and flavor. Unfortunately since she was diagnose with diabetes she can no longer enjoy it. Maybe in the future you could consider making a sugar free coffee ice cream.
51_breyers,2,11.0,5.0,Has this coffee ice cream recipe changed? I remember it being very different and much better. Now its more like a soft ice cream instead of real ice cream that stays hard in the freezer. Please bring back the old recipe!!!

51_breyers,2,8.0,5.0,"Breyers Coffee flavored ice cream was always one of my favorite, second to your Natural Vanilla with real vanilla bean!

51_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"Not sure why everyone is hating on the coffee flavour. It’s different, light, fresh and way less bloating than the original recipe. Also, it’s 100 calories. Try eating it in a cone, ice cream always tastes better in a cone. I love it!!!! Thank you for making this."
51_breyers,1,7.0,4.0,"Very little taste. Not ice cream. but frozen dairy dessert. Very little taste. I used to trust Breyers but this is not even close to ice cream. Leaves an after taste and I will not buy your ""frozen dairy dessert"" again."
51_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This is one of the few treats I can enjoy due to my diet and having to remove all foods containing calcium oxalates. I hope it will come back to my area and save my more bland diet. Used to get it fairly regularly but cant find it now !

51_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,The coffee ice cream is my absolute favorite as creamy taste is fabulous! Nobody makes a better coffee!

51_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"Taste excellent. Better than other coffee ice creams I have had in the past. Has an excellent coffee flavor, not artificial tasting (like others) -- real coffee flavor, sweet -- yet healthy formula, without too much sugar or saturated fat."

54_breyers,2,3.0,1.0,"Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Chocolate and started only carrying this Extra Creamy Chocolate. The list of ingredients is not the same, and the flavor is absolutely not the same. The Extra Creamy does not have that nice chocolate punch at the end and has some off flavors. I just this morning found Chocolate at another store and did a side-by-side taste test - not even close. I will be going out of my way to find Chocolate and will take a pass on the Extra Creamy."
54_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,"I consume (& enjoy) a large quantity of chocolate ice cream. About 50 gallons per year. Chocolate is about the only flavor for me. IF you want true, intense chocolate flavor, ""extra creamy"" is NOT the best choice. For me, the chocolate flavor was subdued. IF your preference is to have a balanced taste of vanilla & chocolate, then extra creamy chocolate may be perfect! The quality of this flavor is high, just not to my liking as much. Enjoy!"
54_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"I accidentally purchased this flavor instead of the original chocolate - similar pictures and description. The flavor was bland, barely a faint chocolate flavor. The texture reminded me of cheap ice cream - gummy, filmy - not a clean mouthfeel."
54_breyers,2,2.0,1.0,"The new ""dairy dessert"" is really unfortunate. All of the grocery stores near me sell only this ""toy ice cream"" instead o the real thing. I used to adore Breyers--so clean tasting with such good chocolate flavor....but never tasted greasy like the super high fat ice creams (dislike those, though I realize now how much better they are than this soft slop youre putting out.)"

55_breyers,5,7.0,0.0,"My husband and myself like Black Raspberry and Cherry Vanilla. However I noticed that there are less cherries in them now. I would like coupons also. I dont appreciate the amount of ice cream you have lessened it to and charge more for, but I will still buy it because it is the best."
55_breyers,5,7.0,0.0,The Black Raspberry Chocolate is so delicious. There is just the right amount of chocolate chips and raspberry ice cream. I am pleasantly surprised to see so many different flavors that are gluten free and it is natural with no food coloring and flavors! Thank you!
55_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,This Black Raspberry Chocolate chip ice cream is SO good I had to get on here & warn my ice cream lovers of how amazingly good it truly is. Im not going to write a long review getting into details. Im just going to state what I said. Now you can go buy it & decide for yourself. YUM!!!

56_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I’m not a huge ice cream fan. But this flavor is so exceptionally delicious that the exact right superlative doesn’t exist. Sounds hyperbolic but it is the basic truth. If you LOVE chocolate, insist that your chocolate have a rich dense flavor that awakens every tastebud in your mouth, then you can’t go wrong with this ice cream flavor. I’ve seen other reviews that complained of hit or miss quality and I have to say I’ve never had a bad batch. Of course I wish there were more truffles, but I’ve never felt like I got ripped off or cheated."

57_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,This is undoubtedly the best ice cream I have ever had. I was hesitant to try salted caramel ice cream because I do not like salt. I love caramel though. Breyers happened to be the first I tried. I have tried others but always came back to Breyers. Now I dont have anything but (and it doesnt hurt that it is lower in calories and fat than most other ice creams).
57_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,I watch my saturated fats and I avoid whey. This good tasting ice cream has only 2 Sats and no whey. Great product.
57_breyers,4,4.0,2.0,I love this ice cream. My only problem with it is that there are small rubber pieces mixed in. Ive tried several cartons and it is in every single one.
57_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"I liked it....but not enough to buy again. I wanted more of a ""ribbon"" of caramel. Plus, I actually like more of a sea salt taste....this was not enough of that. It was creamy, but just didnt completely satisfy my ice cream craving."
58_breyers,5,14.0,1.0,"I recently bought an ice cream cake for my boyfriends birthday from cold stone. It was a night mare from the beginning, they forgot to make it, decorated it terribly (they were apologetic teenagers and didnt want to make them feel bad) and there was barely any ice cream in the cake. The lack of actual ice cream was almost mind blowing. All this goes without saying if I had known this ice cream flavor existed I would have bought a few and wrote happy birthday on the top. It tastes better, and has a legitimate ice cream cake flavor we were hoping for not all the cake you can see below!"
58_breyers,5,8.0,0.0,PLEASE KEEP THIS AS A PERMANENT FLAVOR!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!! I LOVE THIS ICE CREAM! MY FAVORITE EVER!
58_breyers,5,10.0,0.0,"I cant believe it took me so long to find this flavor!!! THE FLAVORS ARE EXACTLY LIKE CARVELS ICE CREAM CAKES, right down to chocolate crumble. Ive always enjoyed Breyers ice cream, but this flavor takes...the cake. By far. Over any other ice cream brand, and other Breyers flavors themselves. A must have in any freezer! The only point of feedback I have is that the proportion of chocolate crumble to vanilla could be shifted from 1:3 to 1:2."
58_breyers,5,12.0,0.0,I am absolutely in LOVE with the chocolate crunchy center! Ive bought this flavor over and over again the past few weeks. Obsessed!!! I wish I could eat this flavor for the rest of my life!
58_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,My ice cream cake container contained zero crunchies my kids were very disappointed. I had to try ice cream without crunchies and yes it was very disappointing. I will be calling in a complaint tomorrow. Ugh!
58_breyers,1,7.0,1.0,This flavor claims to have chocolate crunch but the crunch is missing! My container was just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Very disappointed.
58_breyers,2,2.0,0.0,"I bought this flavor over others, including other brands because it says there are chocolate crunchies in here like ice cream cake has, easily the best part of ice cream cake! Was on special at my grocer so I purchased. I opened this and no crunchies are inside the chocolate ice cream section whatsoever. I dug deeper thinking maybe they were just buried but none were found. Can I get a refund please??"
58_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,What more could you ask for than fresh vanilla ice cream and the best chocolate ice cream middle with the chocolate crunch mixed in! This is a family fav!
58_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"This flavor has become one of my familys favorite flavors. I have to agree with others who feel that they should add more chocolate with cookie pieces by making it either half vanilla and half chocolate or by making a flavor that is just the chocolate with cookie pieces in it. Either way, there needs to be more of the chocolate with the cookie pieces."
58_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Please, please, please dont get rid of this flavor! The chocolate center with those delectable crunchies is amazing. I could eat a bowl of nothing but the chocolate center. How about all chocolate with the crunchies with fudge ribbons and a few thin rows of vanilla. Anyway, this is in my top three favorite flavors. Top two actually!"
58_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"I recently stumbled across this flavor at my grocery store the other day and was super excited to try this. Glad to say it didn’t disappoint. I wish there was a little more chocolate ice cream and it could use more of the crunchies but overall still a very good flavor. To whoever came up with this idea, you deserve a raise."
58_breyers,1,4.0,1.0,I was very disappointed! flavors were ok but have better varieties of this old favorite from other brands. Not one cruchie in mine one of four family members had a small amount will stick with our Breyers favorites we have many.
58_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,My favorite part about this flavor is the chocolate with the crunchy pieces in it. Then there is the vanilla on the outsides to create a balance. This is y new favorite ice cream and i can not stop eating it.
58_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Suggestion to a perfect ice cream: add more of the chocolate ice cream and cookie section. Sometimes the chocolate part is smaller than other times.
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This ice cream tastes just like a carvel or friendly’s ice cream cake from my childhood!! It is sooo delicious!! I can’t get enough. I would love to see this become a half vanilla and half chocolate with crunchies but will take it just as it is as well! Never stop making it. Sell at more stores!!
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"To start - I have never felt compelled to write a review on ice cream - however, that all changed with ""Ice Cream Cake. Just FANTASTIC. Great vanilla and chocolate flavors, lots of crunches. I would agree with other reviewers that a 50% 50% split would make it even better!"
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I have to admit that the first time I tried this ice cream I was a little bit hesitant to try it, thinking there was no way it could be all that great. But what a surprise, the vanilla,chocolate and crunchies are fantastic. I buy this every time I buy ice cream."
58_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,My ice cream was all chocolate on top and vanilla in the bottom. The first box I was pleased my container was identical to the Box picture. The taste was good just wish I had the crunch in the middle. Can you send me a coupon ? I appreciate it.
58_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,I bought this and was so excited to eat it. When I opened it there were no Chunchies and the chocolate looked so light. I was worried that something was defiantly wrong with the batch.
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Delicious not too much but perfect. Crunchie cookie like Ice cream cake all in the middle where the chocolate is. Then the basic vanilla is surrounded on each side its perfect
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,One of the Best flavors there is on the market!!! PLEASE dont discontinue this Ice Cream Cake flavor. Its a Winner hands down! We love it!
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Great mix of choc and vanilla. The chrunchies make it yummy.
58_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This flavor is good ...please keep this one! : ) I LOVE it!
59_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"Saw this flavor at a big national chain, picked it up and it is shockingly good. It has plentiful amounts of coconut flavor, striped with fudge. It may be on the sweeter side, but still a new favorite from Breyers."
59_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Tastes like a mounds bar party in my mouth. Perfect ratio of coconut to chocolate. Hits the spot in the summer. So delicious!
60_breyers,5,9.0,0.0,"OH for the love of ice cream! I decided to try this one day because it looked similar to my local ice cream parlors ""Buckeye"" flavor. Well I was not disappointed! However, I am disappointed in myself for letting my kids try it, all three of them love it too. I really hope this flavor will be available for years to come we love it that much. The peanut butter is so creamy, it blends so well with the chocolate. Two favorite flavors masterfully combined. Thank you Breyers!"
60_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"This ice cream is delicious. It is a rich and creamy dark chocolate with a salty, slightly crispy ribbon of peanut butter. The combination is perfect. I always say I will try a new flavor on any given week. The second I see this flavor I say ""Ill try something new next week"", and grab this one. The peanut butter is not an overly sweet and creamy peanut butter. It is the real thing with the salty favor. Just a perfect combination. This is my guilty pleasure and I enjoy every bite!"
60_breyers,2,4.0,0.0,"I got this ice cream from the grocery store and really liked the flavor and the amount of peanut butter in it, so I bought a second carton when the first was gone. To my surprise, the second carton of ice cream had no peanut butter in it at all! It was labeled chocolate peanut butter, but contained no peanut butter whatsoever. it just felt like I was eating plain chocolate ice cream. Breyers really needs to make sure their batches are consistant."
60_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"Been buying this for years and it has always been so great. Over the last three to four months though, Ive noticed a huge change. Barely any peanut butter has been in the last 6 cartons we have purchased (all over about a 3 - 4 month period). Im talking less than a teaspoon of peanut butter per whole container (if even that). Basically it is just chocolate now ice cream now. I thought it was just a fluke but it has been like this the last 6 cartons (all bought during different weeks). It used to be so good. Wish they had not changed the recipe."
60_breyers,4,2.0,0.0,"This quickly became mine and my husbands favorite ice cream! However the last two gallons we purchased had no peanut butter in them very sad. Hoping you didn’t change the recipe to include less peanut butter because it was perfect before. Maybe it was a bad batch, but if it wasn’t my recommendation would be to change it back, I look forward to trying again later to see if it’s yummy again!"
60_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"This is the best ice cream Ive ever tasted! There are so many choices out there, but this flavor beats all of them!"
60_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,Great flavor of peanut butter and chocolate without any chemical taste
60_breyers,5,3.0,1.0,"Hi Breyers, You got it right! Ive had some of your other Penut Butter flavors and found them to be artificial - not a good taste. However, this one is awesome. No artificial Penut Butter flavors, texture was creamy, chocolate ice cream tasted great. Please keep making this one. Of course, more or chunky Penut Butter would be even better. Cheers"
60_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Just wrote a bad review of the Reese’s Chocolate with peanut butter swirl. That one is extremely disappointing. This one rocks!! Much darker chocolate ice cream and enough peanut butter swirl to make even Reese’s blush! Love it!!!
60_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,"Ive been buying breyers for many years and my grocery store just switched to your brand for the chocolate peanut butter flavor. I was excited to see that my favorite store now had my favorite flavor in my favorite brand! Long story short, I bought the last 2 cartons in the freezer and I guess that I might as well have just bought plain chocolate because I have yet to find any peanut butter! Very dissatisfied and feel ripped off."
60_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,One of the best peanut butter ice creams available. Generous layers of peanut butter that turns creamy when eating. A perfect salty and sweet dessert.
60_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,Amazing ice cream. Best peanut butter chocolate ice on the market. Im a big peanut butter fan so of course more is better but its still fantastic!
60_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Breyers outdid itself with both the richness of the chocolate ice cream. It is a dark and flavorful chocolate that compliments the perfect amount of added creamy peanut butter. I cannot think of how to make this flavor any better. I have been making chocolate peanut butter ice cream for years because there was good commercial alternative. Breyere is now ny new favorite!
60_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"HUN, this ice cream is my favorite so far and i had PLENTY of your ice creams and theyre sooooo good but hun, i love this the best. Peanut butter and chocolate omlll yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!! anyway, i love this product and i would get 100 more."

60_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,I found absolutely no peanut butter in this very very disappointed
60_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,My favorite ice cream love it. It has all natural ingredients.
61_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,These cups are the perfect size for my kids! I also noticed that they are 100 calories so they would also be the great size for a snack for someone counting calories. The ingredients are great and so is the taste. I’m sure they would be great for toppings as well!
61_breyers,4,4.0,1.0,"These are the perfect size for my kiddos. I love how simply the ingrediance list is. I wish vegetable gum could be replaced, but when compared with most other ice cream 6 ingredient is a winner in my book. The taste is amazing I love the strong vanillla flavor. The only thing that would make this product better is them coming in a chocolate vanilla combo pack. Great product!"
61_breyers,5,5.0,1.0,"Always in the freezer for snacking, its delicious! Get some!"
61_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I enjoy the Oreo snack cups so I thought I would try the vanilla cups. They were really more ice and no cream. Giving them the benefit of the doubt I bought another pack a few weeks later and the same problem! They were hard as a rock and when I let them thaw a bit they were watery. Too much water and no cream....
61_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"I personally love these for my children! I have a 4, 2, and 1 year old and they love ice cream. I love the convenience of these pre portioned sizes with the quality natural delicious ice cream that Breyer’s always gives us.

62_breyers,1,6.0,1.0,The butterscotch flavor is good but there are no blondie chunks in the entire tub of ice cream. Not a single one! Very disappointed
62_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"I am addicted to Butterscotch Blondie. My friend was going to the store and asked if I needed something, and I told her yes my Bryers Butterscotch Blondie. She called me from the store and said they were out of it. Did I want some other flavor, I said no, nothing but my Butterscotch Blondie. I would accept nothing else, so she quit asking. I said thank you, but Ill wait. I love it, I love it, I love it."
62_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,"I havent had Breyers since I was a kid and the quality is totally different than I remember. My brain and taste buds dont even recognize this as ice cream. The soft, fluffy and smooth texture is like eating whipped topping. I cant taste the milk/cream flavor that is present in most all ice creams, instead its just super sweet. The entire thing comes off as highly artificial chemical goo. I like the texture of the blondies but they taste weird on their own."
62_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,"Bryers has done it again, a beautiful symphony of butterscotch and ice cream. Its a marvelous blend I bought on a hot day on a whim. This will not disappoint your pallet for sure!"
62_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This flavor is truly amazing. It tastes so delightful and I just cant get over the bites of blondie in it. My new fav!
62_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I am in love with it....only thing I would suggest is more blondie pieces throughout the ice cream...it really makes my mouth light up with delight when I discover a piece of soft gooey blondie mixed with the creamy goodness of butterscotch. This is your best flavor yet...I never EVER write reviews but this flavor was so magical to me to the point where I felt like you all needed to know. Great job Breyers!
62_breyers,3,1.0,0.0,"The ice cream is ok, but I was disappointed with the lack of butterscotch flavor. Its there with bites of the blondies, but its too faint. Still good, just not what I was hoping for."
62_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,I was excited I love butterscotch this was such a let down. Yes it was vanilla but not even a good vanilla. tasted like frozen whipped cream.
62_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This is my favorite Breyers flavor so far, but it is hard to find in the grocery stores."
62_breyers,4,1.0,0.0,Creamy butterscotch taste. A blondie in each bite. Add pecans for a extra treat.
62_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Sometimes hit or miss on amount of chunks but ooooh so tasty!
63_breyers,5,9.0,0.0,"I am always checking out the smaller packages of ice cream because I like the automatic portion control. Unfortunately, Im picky so I struggle to find something I like. Today I was in the frozen foods and looked over and saw something I hadnt seen before, mini Breyers. I was a little disappointed when I thought they only came in vanilla, but then I saw the chocolate! It was a slam dunk right into my card. When I was checking out, the woman at the register was surprised to see them come through, she had no idea they existed. She loves Breyers; I wouldnt be surprised if she stopped in the frozen foods aisle herself today. The chocolate is great as ever; and the size was perfect! Thank you for creating something I never knew I wanted.:)"
63_breyers,4,3.0,1.0,"Classic chocolate and vanilla in small single serving size. Great taste without overdoing it. Only two requests...Please include some wooden spoons in each pack (plastic spoons arent as strong), and please do this size in Mint Chocolate Chip."
64_breyers,4,7.0,0.0,"I agree with some reviewers that the cinnamon is not homogeneously distributed in every scoop, but it’s a nice taste. The Cinnabon dough bites add a kick of cinnamon and sugar. I wish they would put more dough bites in"
64_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,"Amazing, would highly recommend. Its vanilla ice cream with dough bites and a cinnamon swirl throughout the ice cream. It is really sweet so if thats not your thing you might not like it."
64_breyers,5,5.0,0.0,So good with lots of cinnamon roll bits throughout the center. It is lighter on bits around the edges and top but not by much. Very tasty!
64_breyers,2,8.0,4.0,"Not enough flavor throughout the container. The people who are the first to dive into the container basically get vanilla ice cream. When subsequent servings are served, you get more flavor but definitely not in every bite. I believe this happened once before with a new Breyer’s flavor. Disappointing"
64_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,"This is a smooth, creamy vanilla ice cream with just the perfect hint of cinnamon goodness. Not too sweet but oh so good. I will definitely buy this again. I can’t wait to serve this on top of apple pie or even a coffee cake. Love the chewy mini cinnamon cups in this too. Just adds a little bit of texture and a whole lot of deliciousness! Love it. Thank you!!"
64_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,When I first had this ice cream it was loaded with dough bites and cinnamon and since then it has been different every time. No dough bites in the last few containers and barely any cinnamon! I’m surprised Cinnabon is putting their name on this. Honestly the new Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream is MUCH better. Disappointing.

65_breyers,4,7.0,0.0,"You mean I can indulge in ice cream for dessert, and it’s only 60 calories!? It’s a dream come true! These bars have a lovely, subtle caramel taste. Unlike other light ice creams, these bars are nice and soft right out of the freezer. Absolutely satisfy my sweet tooth. Wish there were more flavors!"
65_breyers,5,4.0,0.0,"Really, Breyers should offer this very creamy and tasty item via carton in the same size as the chocolate, vanilla and the peanut butter :-)"
65_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,This is most satisfying low carb bar ever. The taste is better caramel vanilla ice cream. If your medically ordered low carb like me this is the dessert treat for you.
65_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Ive been intermittent keto for the past year and finding low-carb sweet snacks has been HARD!! This ice cream bar is the best I have found. It is smooth and creamy without any fake sugar taste. I cant wait to try all the flavors!!
66_breyers,5,3.0,0.0,"Based on previous reviews, it seems a few didnt like it, but I personally did. It is actually one of my new favorite flavors so far. Have been trying to find a smores ice cream that was actually good since my favorite smores ice cream were discontinued by another company a few years ago. New favorite is this one now!"
66_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,S’mores flavored is cream is one of my favorites. Brewers usually has great quality and therefore yummy ice cream so I was excited to see this flavor in the store. This version is very disappointing. The marshmallows are really gross-weird textures-almost like stale hard mini marshmallows you threw in your ice cream. The Graham was almost non existent but that’s ok since it also was off in texture and flavor. Try again Brewers but maybe go for a marshmallow cream swirl and chocolate covered Graham cracker pieces.
66_breyers,1,5.0,1.0,I was really looking forward to this ice cream but its actually gross. It tastes like really strong cinnamon and cardboard. :(
66_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"I love ice cream and saw this at the store so I figured I would try Smores along with the Peach cobbler. I tried the Smores first, along with my family, and it was awful. taste nothing like Smores. The graham cracker was grainy, marshmallows tasted like vanilla frosting. Will NOT buy again."
66_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,Marshmallows are chalky while the graham cracker piece does leave a lot to be desired. Please try again I would gladly give it another try when the contents are changed.
66_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,This is so bad we may just throw it out... cant say anything good about it..didnt taste like smores.. chocolate barely chocolatey. who knows what the middle flavor was.. this was nasty Very disappointed.. Breyers usually has good flavors.. this will go in the trash.. not worth the calories..
66_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,This ice cream is not even close to a s’more. Way too much little tiny chewy marshmallow pieces and no crunch graham crackers. The marshmallows have an odd taste. They could have done so much better with a classic summer desert. Really bad!
67_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,This is so good! I wouldn’t change anything but the color of the peach icecream is a little too orange like an orange-sicle. It’s not becoming for how wonderfully natural the flavor it! The cobbler pieces are like eating real homemade crust from cobbler. The peach bits are ripe and densely sweet. I love the contrast of flavors with the peach and cream flavors. I WISH THIS WAS NOT LIMITED EDITION :(.
67_breyers,1,5.0,1.0,I order my groceries online and had ordered Breyers Peach Ice Cream. They substituted Breyers Peach Cobbler. Much prefer for the regular Bryers Peach for taste. This just did not have the peach taste.
67_breyers,5,5.0,2.0,I dont think in my 39 years of living that I have ever written a review on ice cream. This ice cream is the best Ive ever tasted! I had no idea it was called layer dessert when I was in the grocery store I just saw breyers and I saw peach cobbler and I bought it. If you love peach cobbler and ice cream you will love this!
67_breyers,5,4.0,1.0,"I bought this on a whim. This is one of the best ice cream flavors I have eaten. For someone that eats ice cream all the time I will say that this is amazing. It has cobbler pieces as, well as peaches in it. I hope this stays as a permanent flavor!"
67_breyers,5,2.0,0.0,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make this a regular item and not limited edition. I’m obsessed with this ice cream. I eat it every day!!
67_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,I have loved peach ice cream for years ! One dellivery company retired it and I’ve had a few others but this Brewers peach is really good ! Could use a little more peach flavor and peaches but otherwise don’t change anything else .. please keep this in the freezer section to be enjoyed year round !
67_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,Very natural peach flavor with a creaminess to it. My favorite is the middle vanilla creme section with doughy bits of undercooked pie dough. I wish Breyers would make just the creamy dough by itself. This will be a regular in my freezer. I hope its not seasonal.
67_breyers,5,1.0,0.0,This is actually my favorite ice cream ever!! I absolutely love the shortbread cookie part of it!! I also loved the flavor of the peach part too. I will most definitely keep on purchasing this if it keeps on coming out.
67_breyers,2,2.0,1.0,too much shortbread flavor the peaches were not good.
68_breyers,3,4.0,0.0,"So my family would buy 2 containers a week of this particular flavor at one point. Over time we noticed he flavors were becoming more and more bland, and then the most recent time we purchased it, there was not a SINGLE SOLITAIRY piece of brownie or cheesecake in the mix. All honesty, the cheesecake pieces and ice cream didnt really taste like cheesecake, and the chocolate ice cream itself has even become bland and flavorless at this point anyways. But still, the pieces of brownie and cheesecake pieces themselves were almost the whole point of us buying this instead of spending our money on the overpriced Ben & Jerrys. Now its looking like we may have to. Hopefully Breyers is willing to do something about this problem. Fix in some way."
68_breyers,1,5.0,0.0,Brownie Cheesecake is terrible. I’m surprised. It’s just 2/3 chocolate ice cream with 1/3 weird cheesecake ice cream. There are no chunks of brownie or cheesecake at all. Certainly not like the picture on the box at all.
68_breyers,1,3.0,1.0,"This is a disappointment to me from Breyers. None of the ice cream in this concoction has flavor. The pieces put in both the chocolate and cheesecake parts do not taste good at all. I cant even describe it. Breyers needs to pull this one and work on it some more. Not up to par with the quality of their other flavors, for example chocolate truffle. The Cinnabon ice cream itself is delicious, however the ""bun"" pieces in it leaves a little to be desired. Both carbsmart ice creams are delicious, and so on. The Brownie Cheesecake is the first that I have not cared for because of the lack of proper flavoring."
68_breyers,2,3.0,1.0,"When grocery shopping, I was in the mood for ice cream with brownies, and I found this, but to my disappointment, this ice cream was very much lacking any brownie or cheesecake pieces, so sad."
68_breyers,1,2.0,1.0,"This was a waste of money. My mom bought this flavor to surprise me on my period and It’s bland, boring and honestly? A waste of calories. Do better breyers. Do better."
68_breyers,1,2.0,0.0,This would have been amazing but the chocolate ice cream tastes and looks nothing like chocolate. It tasted awful. There must be a production mistake because it doesn’t even look like the picture. I would upload a picture but it won’t load. Essentially it looks like vanilla with a tint of beige
68_breyers,2,1.0,0.0,"We really love the cheesecake version of a competitive ice cream brand. Was really hoping Breyers version would be equally good. We were very disappointed - no one in our family liked it. Didnt notice any cheesecake chunks, not creamy (and we noticed this was a frozen dairy dessert - not ice cream). The flavor was artificial to us. We were so bummed and I hope they can improve this. We tried to eat it twice and just ended up throwing it away."
68_breyers,1,1.0,0.0,Cheesecake and brownies are my two favorite desserts. I was over the moon to see this in the store and to be able to get it as a birthday treat for myself. It was so terrible and disappointing. The ice cream tasted very watered down while the brownie and cheesecake pieces all we’re very bland. It was a serious let down.
