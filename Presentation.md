# Presentation Plan

Max: Slides 1-3 (2-3 minutes)
* New ice cream company looking for a new flavor to make
* Where do we start?
* We decided to look at customer reviews of four different companies and dozens of flavors
* Used NLP to parse through written-out reviews for deeper analysis
* Streamline product development and make it more efficient
* instead of going through so much back and forth with experimentation, we can be much more efficient with our time
* As I said earlier, we can make the product development process more efficient and cut out several steps
