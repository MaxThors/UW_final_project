# Machine Learning

For this project we will be developing an unsupervised machine learning model to help us determine if a new ice cream flavor will have a high rating. We will have already filtered the initial dataset to contain only products with high ratings (>=4), and examine the text of the reviews of the high ratings data. Using NLP, we will identify key words in the text and the data will then be clustered together by common themes.

Because of the filtering, the model will be using the whole dataset as input, which is why an unsupervised model was chosen.

The initial preprocessed data containing products with high ratings can be located in the Resources folder. Anything with a rating greater than or equal to 4.0 was placed into a new dataframe (high_rating_df). The "subhead" column was dropped from this dataset because only Ben & Jerry's brand contained a subhead. Additional columns may be dropped during segment 2.

Once the NLP process is complete, it will be decided if the data needs to be scaled. We will also need to convert the relevant string columns to a numerical format and drop ones that can't be used.
