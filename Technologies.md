### Technologies Used

## Segment One

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas & Jupyter Notebook was used to clean the data by dropping columns that are unnecessary for our analysis and filtering the dataset for helpful and high rated reviews only.  Further exploratory analysis will be completed using Python.

We are planning to use Github as the primary location to share our notebooks, but may incorporate Google Colab as well.

### Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use.
There is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which provides a snapshot of our data structures and a schema detailing how database tables were created.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using.  We intend to use Unsupervised ML and will provide futher details in the Segment Two.


### Dashboard
We intend to integrate Tableau to visualize the data.
